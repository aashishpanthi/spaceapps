    "description": "The Canadian CASSIOPE satellite, operated by the University of Calgary, carries the Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (e-POP) suite of scientific instruments to study the ionosphere, where space meets the upper atmosphere. The instruments collect data about the effects of solar storms and, more specifically, their harmful impact on radio communications, satellite navigation and other space and ground-based technologies. The eight science instruments include imaging plasma and neutral particle sensors, magnetometers, radio wave receivers, dual-frequency GPS receivers, CCD cameras, and a beacon transmitter. The imaging plasma sensors (SEI and IRM) measure particle distributions and the magnetometers (MGF) measure field aligned currents on the time scale of 10-ms and spatial scale of ~100 m. The neutral mass and velocity spectrometer (NMS) measures the density and velocity of major atmospheric species. The CCD cameras (FAI) perform auroral imaging on the time scale of one second. The radio wave and GPS receivers (RRI and GAP) perform near real-time imaging studies of the ionosphere, in conjunction with ground-based radars, as does the beacon transmitter (CER), in conjunction with ground receiving stations. Data from these scientific instruments are available on the University of Calgary website: https://epop.phys.ucalgary.ca/data/). You cans also download here an extract of the telemetry data that lists a variety of CASSIOPE positions, velocities and altitudes based on UTC time.",

This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for seven measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Summary dataset provides a full snapshot of clinic services and profile, patient characteristics, and ART success rates. It is worth noting that patient medical characteristics, such as age, diagnosis, and ovarian reserve, affect ART treatment’s success. Comparison of success rates across clinics may not be meaningful because of differences in patient populations and ART treatment methods. The success rates displayed in this dataset do not reflect any one patient’s chance of success.

    "description": "This dataset contains model-based place (incorporated and census-designated places) estimates. PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at  www.cdc.gov/places.",

This study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) and National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) to identify outbreak investigation characteristics associated with outbreak investigation success. We identified investigation characteristics that increase the probability of successful outbreak investigations: a robust epidemiology investigation method; a thorough environmental assessment, as measured by number of visits to complete the assessment; and the collection of clinical samples. This research highlights the importance of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, which includes epidemiology, environmental health, and laboratory personnel working together to solve the outbreak.",

    "description": "A poor food safety culture has been described as an emerging risk factor for foodborne illness outbreaks, yet there has been little research on this topic in the retail food industry. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate conceptual domains around food safety culture and develop an assessment tool that can be used to assess food workers’ perceptions of their restaurant’s food safety culture. The study, conducted from March 2018 through March 2019, surveyed restaurant food workers for their level of agreement with 28 statements. We received 579 responses from 331 restaurants spread across eight different health department jurisdictions. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling supported a model composed of four primary constructs. The highest rated construct was Resource Availability (\n=4.69, sd=0.57), which assessed the availability of resources to maintain good hand hygiene. The second highest rated construct was Employee Commitment (=4.49, sd=0.62), which assessed workers’ perceptions of their coworkers’ commitment to food safety. The last two constructs were related to management. Leadership (=4.28, sd=0.69) assessed the existence of food safety policies, training, and information sharing. Management Commitment (=3.94, sd=1.05) assessed whether food safety was a priority in practice. Finally, the model revealed one higher-order construct, Worker Beliefs about Food Safety Culture (=4.35, sd=0.53). The findings from this study can support efforts by the restaurant industry, food safety researchers, and health departments to examine the influence and effects of food safety culture within restaurants.",

BCPP was a community randomized trial that examined the impact of prevention interventions on HIV incidence in 15 intervention and 15 control communities. The interventions included extensive HIV testing, linkage to care, and universal treatment services. To reduce HIV incidence in the intervention communities, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals were used: 90% of HIV-positive persons know their status; 90% of persons who know status are to be on ART; 90% of persons on ART are to be virally suppressed. The BCPP study is composed of 2 interlocking protocols: Evaluation Protocol and Intervention Protocol. The Evaluation Protocol of the BCPP evaluated the primary endpoint (HIV incidence), as well as some key related secondary endpoints. This protocol focused on the Baseline Household Survey; the HIV Incidence Cohort; and an End of Study Survey. The Intervention Protocol of the BCPP implemented the combination prevention (CP) intervention package in CPCs and measures the uptake of these interventions (expanded HIV testing and counselling, strengthened male circumcision, and expanded HIV Care and Treatment).",

This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Data collection began on April 23, 2020. Beginning in Phase 3.5 (on June 1, 2022), NCHS included questions about the presence of symptoms of COVID that lasted three months or longer. Phase 3.5 will continue with a two-weeks on, two-weeks off collection and dissemination approach. ",

Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).",

It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.",

These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003–2015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005–2007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).",

    "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. ",

Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions. Prior to December 15, 2022, hospitals reported data directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System (UHDSS).\nWhile CDC reviews these data for errors and corrects those found, some reporting errors might still exist within the data. To minimize errors and inconsistencies in data reported, CDC removes outliers before calculating the metrics. CDC and partners work with reporters to correct these errors and update the data in subsequent weeks.\nMany hospital subtypes, including acute care and critical access hospitals, as well as Veterans Administration, Defense Health Agency, and Indian Health Service hospitals, are included in the metric calculations provided in this report. Psychiatric, rehabilitation, and religious non-medical hospital types are excluded from calculations.\nData are aggregated and displayed for hospitals with the same Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Certification Number (CCN), which are assigned by CMS to counties based on the CMS Provider of Services files.\nFull details on COVID-19 hospital data reporting guidance can be found here: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf\n\n",

Then, we utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center.

Land use categories of cropland, pasture, primary land, secondary (recovering) land, and urban land, and underlying annual land-use transitions, are included. Annual data on age and biomass density of secondary land, as well as annual wood harvest, are included for each grid cell. Historical land cover data for the years 1500 - 2005 are based on HYDE 3.1 and future land cover projections for the period 2006 - 2100 came from four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios which reach different levels of radiative forcing by year 2100: MESSAGE (8.5 W/m2), AIM (6 W/m2), GCAM (4.5 W/m2), and IMAGE (2.6 W/m2). A key feature of these data is that historical reconstructions of land use were harmonized (computationally adjusted to minimize differences at the transition period) with modeled future scenarios, allowing for a seamless examination of historical and future land use. The output data present a single consistent, spatially gridded set of land-use change scenarios for studies of human impacts on the past, present, and future Earth system. For additional information about the algorithms, inputs, and options used in creating the land use transitions data, please refer to Hurtt et al. (2006) and Hurtt et al.

This hyperspectral library of agricultural crops is developed for all major world crops and was collected by United States Geological Survey (USGS) and partnering volunteer agencies from around the world. Crops include wheat, rice, barley, corn, soybeans, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, chickpeas, lentils, and pigeon peas, which together occupy about 65% of all global cropland areas. The GHISA spectral libraries were collected and collated using spaceborne, airborne (e.g., aircrafts and drones), and ground based hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThe GHISA for Central Asia (GHISACASIA) Version 1 product provides dominant crop data (wheat, rice, corn, alfalfa, and cotton) in different growth stages across the Galaba and Kuva farm fields in the Syr Darya river basin in Central Asia. The GHISA hyperspectral library for the two irrigated areas was developed using Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral data acquired in 2007 and ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc.) Spectroradiometer data acquired in 2006 and 2007. GHISACASIA is extracted from three Hyperion hyperspectral images and several thousands of field ASD Spectroradiometer data. Measurements were taken from 1,232 randomly chosen points scattered across the two farm sites throughout the growing season. All the processing algorithms are coded in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) format and available for download.\r\n\r\nProvided in the .xlsx files are the spectral library including image information, plot IDs, study area, instrument, Julian or acquisition date, and crop type labels for Central Asia sample fields.\r\n",

Emissions for the MCI region were compiled from these resources into nine inventory sources (Table 1):(1) forest biomass and soil carbon, harvested woody products carbon, and agricultural soil carbon from the U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory (EPA, 2010; Heath et al., 2011);(2) high resolution data on fossil and biofuel CO2 emissions from Vulcan (Gurney et al,. 2009); (3) CO2 uptake by agricultural crops, lateral transport in crop biomass harvest, and livestock CO2 emissions using USDA statistics (West et al., 2011); (4) agricultural residue burning (McCarty et al., 2011);(5) CO2 emissions from landfills (EPA, 2012);(6) and CO2 losses from human respiration using U.S. Census data (West et al., 2009). The CO2 inventory in the MCI region was dominated by fossil fuel combustion, carbon uptake during crop production, carbon export in biomass (commodities) from the region, and to a lesser extent, carbon sinks in forest growth and incorporation of carbon into timber products.

    "description": "This dataset provides estimates of wildfire carbon emissions and uncertainties at 30-m resolution, and measurements collected at burned and unburned field plots from the 2014 wildfire sites near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Field data were collected at 211 burned plots in 2015 and include site characteristics, tree cover and species, basal area, delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR), plot characteristics, soil carbon, and carbon combusted. Data were collected at 36 unburned plots with characteristics similar to the burned plots in 2016. The emission estimates were derived from a statistical modeling approach based on measurements of carbon consumption at the 211 burned field plots located in seven independent burn scars. Estimates include uncertainty of field observations of aboveground and belowground combustion, as well as prediction uncertainty from a multiplicative regression model. To apply the model across all 2014 NWT fire perimeters, the final model covariates were re-gridded to a common 30-m grid defined by the Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Project. The regression model was then applied to burned pixels defined by a threshold of Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) within fire perimeters. Derived carbon emissions and uncertainty in g/m2 are provided for each 30-m grid cell. The modeled NWT domain encompasses 29 tiles within the ABoVE 30-m reference grid system.",

Fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxide, and ammonia (CO2, CH4, N2O, NO and NH3) were compiled from the literature and the flux rates were normalized for ease of comparison. Field observations of gas flux following rewetting of dry soils include events caused by natural rainfall, simulated rainfall in natural ecosystems, and irrigation in agricultural lands. Similarly, thawing of frozen soils include field observations of natural thawing, simulated freezing-thawing events (i.e., thawing of simulated frozen soil by snow removal), and thawing of seasonal ice in temperate and high latitude regions (Kim et al., 2012). Reported parameters include experiment type, location, site type, vegetation, climate, soil properties, rainfall, soil moisture, soil gas flux after wetting and thawing, peak soil gas flux properties, and the corresponding study references.

    "description": "A comprehensive global database has been assembled to quantify CO2 fluxes and pathways across different levels of integration (from photosynthesis up to net ecosystem production) in forest ecosystems. The database fills an important gap for model calibration, model validation, and hypothesis testing at global and regional scales. The database archive includes: a Microsoft Office Access Database; data files for all tables in the database; query outputs from the database; and SQL script file for re-creating the database from the tables. The database is structured by site (i.e., a forest or stand of known geographical location, biome, species composition, and management regime). It contains carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (standing biomass, leaf area index, age), and ancillary information (management regime, climate, soil characteristics) for 529 sites from eight forest biomes. Data entries originated from peer-reviewed literature and personal communications with researchers involved in Fluxnet. Flux estimates were included in the database when they were based on direct measurements (e.g., tower-based eddy covariance system measurements), derived from single or multiple direct measurements, or modeled. Stand description was based on observed values, and climatic description was based on the CRU data set and ORCHIDEE model output. Uncertainty for each carbon balance component in the database was estimated in a uniformed way by expert judgment. Robustness of CO2 balances was tested, and closure terms were introduced as a numerical way to approach data quality and flux uncertainty at the biome level.",

NCE estimates are for the combined crop plant harvest and consumption/expiration of fodder by livestock and of food by humans. Estimation of carbon uptake and release from global agricultural production and consumption required compilation and analysis of inventory data from various sources for the years 2005-2011. The flux estimates were spatially distributed to a global 0.05-degree resolution grid using MODIS land cover data. The quantities of carbon flux in each gridcell are represented in two ways: (1) where the quantities of carbon distributed to each gridcell were divided by the total gridcell area, resulting in average carbon fluxes per unit of total area (g C/m2/yr), and (2), where annual carbon fluxes associated with a source were summed over all types for the gridcell (Mg C/yr). The total surface area of the grid cells is provided.There are eight data files in netCDF format (.nc4) with this data set -- two files (per area and per gridcell) for each of the four flux source types.

    "description": "This data set contains information that can be used to examine water fluxes in soils beneath tree crops in an Amazonian agroforest. The data consists of repeated measurements of soil matrix pressure and soil moisture content at several depths. The study was carried out at the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (Embrapa)-Amazonia Ocidental, 29 km North of Manaus, Brazil (3d 8m S, 59d 52m W, 40 - 50 m above sea level), in 1998 and 1999.Microaggregated tropical soils have shown high water conductivity even under unsaturated conditions in laboratory experiments. It is not clear, however, what depth the infiltrating soil water reaches during storm events under humid tropical conditions. Dynamics and fluxes of water were determined with high temporal resolution to a depth of 5 m in a Xanthic Hapludox of central Amazonia, Brazil. The soil water percolated to a depth of 0.9 m within 2 h of a rainfall event of 48 mm. Water fluxes were significantly slower below 0.9 m (17% of infiltration at 0 - 0.9 m) due to higher bulk densities. Percolation not only started rapidly after a rainfall event when soil water suction reached a certain threshold (ca. 20 - 30 hPa) but was also reduced to background levels less than 1 h after the rain had ended. The demonstrated extremely short-term dynamics of water fluxes have implications for measurement design of water availability and solute leaching in microaggregated tropical soil that require correct time integrals of solution concentrations and soil water dynamics. Measurement intervals of 30 min or less were necessary in our study. Rapid water flows may explain the observed high nutrient losses from the topsoil of microaggregated tropical soil and the large accumulation of nutrients in the deep soil (&gt; 5 m).",

The biomass of lianas was calculated using two different allometric equations derived for lianas in Amazonian forests ( Gerwing and Farias, 2000; Gerwing et al. 2004). Comma-separated data files of measurements of (1) tree species (diameter &gt;10 cm), and forest characteristics, (2) measurements of liana diameter, forest characteristics, and calculated biomass, and (3) georeference points for the liana sampling transects are provided.Selective logging has become a dominant land-use in Brazilian Amazonia. Published data on forest biomass in southern Amazonia is sparse. As part of a larger study to evaluate the effect of reduced impact logging on carbon dynamics and nutrient stocks, forest structure, and forest regeneration potential, we conducted a pre-harvest campaign to estimate tree and liana biomass in a parcel of managed forest in northwestern Mato Grosso. Prior to logging in 2003, a scientific inventory was conducted in Block 5 of the logging concession(Figure 1). Tree characteristics for all trees and palms &gt; 10 cm DBH was measured by stratified sampling across the block to account for differences in tree densities (trees/ha). Transects were located using a commercial timber inventory to identify tree trunks approximately 10 cm DBH, lower and upper canopy height, species, and location of all individuals to the nearest 10 cm on an x-y grid. Diameter of all liana stems were included if their ultimate rooting point before ascending into the canopy fell within the transect. Lianas that had been cut due to reduced impact logging practices were also measured. Distance along the transect was recorded for each stem.",

SCAR-B, the third SCAR experiment, was completed in September 1995, studied the effects of biomass burning on atmospheric processes and aids in the preparation of new techniques for remote sensing of these processes from space.The objectives for the SCAR mission are: to advance our knowledge of how the physical, chemical and radiative processes in our atmosphere are affected by sulfate aerosol and smoke from biomass burning; to improve our expertise at remotely sensing smoke, water vapor, clouds, vegetation and fires; and to assess the effects of deforestation and biomass burning on tropical landscapes.The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has produced diurnal GOES-8 derived fire products for the 1995 fire season (June-October 1995) with version 5.5 of the GOES-8 Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (ABBA). The diurnal fire products were produced for 1145, 1445, 1745, and 2045 UTC coinciding with peak burning hours.The GOES-8 Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (ABBA) fire products are derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-8 imager radiances from bands 1 (visible), 2 (3.9 micron), and 4 (11 micron).",

    "title": "Global N Cycle: Fluxes and N2O Mixing Ratios Originating from Human Activity",
    "description": "Nitrogen is a major nutrient in terrestrial ecosystems and an important catalyst in tropospheric photochemistry. Over the last century human activities have dramatically increased inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr, the combination of oxidized, reduced and organically bound nitrogen) to the Earth system. Nitrogen cycle perturbations have compromised air quality and human health, acidified ecosystems, and degraded and eutrophied  lakes and coastal estuaries [Vitousek et al., 1997a, 1997b; Rabalais, 2002; Howarth et al., 2003; Townsend et al., 2003; Galloway et al., 2004]. To begin to quantify the changes to the global N cycle, we have assembled key flux data and N2O mixing ratios from various sources.  The data assembled from different sources includes fertilizer production from 1920-2004;  manure production from 1860-2004; crop N fixation estimated for three time points, 1860, 1900, 1995; tropospheric N2O mixing ratios from ice core and firn measurements, and tropospheric concentrations to cover the time period from 1756-2004.  The changing N2O concentrations provide an independent index of changes to the global N cycle, in much the same way that changing carbon dioxide concentrations provide an important constraint on the global carbon cycle.  The changes to the global N cycle are driven by industrialization, as indicated by fossil fuel NOx emission, and by the intensification of agriculture, as indicted by fertilizer and manure production and crop N2 fixation. The data set and the science it reflects are by nature interdisciplinary.  Making the data set available through the ORNL DAAC is an attempt to make the data set available to the considerable interdisciplinary community studying the N cycle.",

    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nMinor Version 06B is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. \nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Early Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields to provide half-hourly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 4 hours).\n\n\n",

The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.  The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) as a first-guess for the atmospheric state.  Because MERRA-2 products typically have a latency from 3 to 7 weeks, so too do the CLIMCAPS products. \n\nA level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.\n\n",

    "description": "\nWARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.          END OF WARNING.\n\n\n\nThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1B data set contains AIRS calibrated and geolocated radiances in milliWatts/m^2/cm^-1/steradian for 2378 infrared channels in the 3.74 to 15.4 micron region of t he spectrum. The AIRS instrument is co-aligned with AMSU-A so that successive blocks of 3 x 3 AIRS footprints are contained within one AMSU-A footprint. The AIRIBRAD_005 products are stored in files (often referred to as \"granules\") that contain 6 minutes of data, 90 footprints across track by 135 lines along track.",

The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHL and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived late daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHL for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC.

In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.\n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

    "title": "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V002 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This data set contains the primary forcing data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is WMO GRIB-1. \n\nDetails about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing data sets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and\nNLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).\n\nThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).\n\nThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields.  The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. \n\nFor more information, please see the README Document.",

    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nMinor Version 06B is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward/backward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 3.5 months).\n\n\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product provides Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) data generated according to the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the ECOSTRESS Level 4 (ESI_PT-JPL) Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/342/ECO4ESIPTJPL_ATBD_V1.pdf). The ESI product is derived from the ratio of the Level 3 actual evapotranspiration (ET) to potential ET (PET) calculated as part of the algorithm. The ESI is an indicator of potential drought and plant water stress emphasizing areas of sub-optimal plant productivity.\r\n\r\nThe ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product contains layers of ESI and PET.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "title": "GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGDF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team. \n\nVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the Daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHH and giving the result in (mm). \n\nThe latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. \n\nIn the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme.

The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n",

Note that the last acquisition period of each year is a 5 or 6-day composite period, depending on the year.\r\n\r\nValidation at stage 1 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) has been achieved for MODIS Evapotranspiration products.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\r\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\r\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR.

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1C data set contains AIRS infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m2/micron/ster. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1B data. The spectral coverage of L1C data is from 3.74 to 15.4 mm. The nominal spectral resolution lambda / delta lambda = 1200. The spectrum is sampled twice per spectral resolution element in a total of 2645 spectral channels. A day of AIRS data is divided into 240 granules (scenes) each of 6-minute duration. For the AIRS IR measurements, an individual granule contains 135 pixels across-track and 90 along-track pixels; there are total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 pixels per granule. AIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit with the 13.5 x 13.5 km2 spatial resolution at nadir. The L1C swath products are derived from the L1B swath products. The primary purpose of the level 1C is to generate the spectra of radiances without spectral gaps caused by the instrument design and bad spectral points. The AIRS L1C data can be used for comparative (with other IR measurements) studies and for weather-climate research.\n\nThis is the latest version of this collection.

    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nMinor Version 06B is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward/backward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 3.5 months).\n\n\n",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version. \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency&amp;#8217;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

Daymet variables include the following parameters: minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, vapor pressure, snow water equivalent, and day length. The dataset covers the period from January 1, 1980, to December 31 (or December 30 in leap years) of the most recent full calendar year for the Continental North America and Hawaii spatial regions. Data for Puerto Rico is available starting in 1950. Each subsequent year is processed individually at the close of a calendar year. Daymet variables are provided as individual files, by variable and year, at a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution. Areas of Hawaii and Puerto Rico are available as files separate from the continental North America. Data are in a North America Lambert Conformal Conic projection and are distributed in a standardized Climate and Forecast (CF)-compliant netCDF file format. In Version 4 R1 (ver 4.4), all 2020 and 2021 files were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 R1 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs. Files outside of 2020 and 2021 have not changed from the previous V4 release.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive.  \n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 GRACE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 24 land surface fields from February 1, 2003 to present.\n\nThe simulation started on February 1, 2003 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 Daily Catchment model simulation, forced with the meteorological analysis fields from the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System.  The total terrestrial water anomaly observation from GRACE satellite was assimilated (Li et al, 2019). Due to the data agreement with ECMWF, this GLDAS-2.2 daily product does not include the meteorological forcing fields.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

The DVD contained all of the SBUV/2 data from NOAA-9, NOAA-11 and NOAA-16 satellites as well as SBUV data from the Nimbus-7 satellite. The DVD is no longer available, however all the data are available on-line from the NASA GES DISC. The Nimbus-7 SBUV v8 data are available from 1978-10-31 to 1990-06-21. The instrument spatial resolution is 180 km x 180 km footprint at nadir. The ozone profiles are made at 21 pressure levels between 1000 and 0.1 hPa. Each data file contains a days worth of ozone measurements, and is written in an ASCII text format.\n\nThe SBUV measures incoming solar irradiance and radiance backscattered by the atmosphere at 12 wavelengths in the UV range [0.25-0.34 micrometer] with a spectral band pass of 0.001 micrometer. The wavelength channels used for ozone retrievals for SBUV were: 256, 273, 283, 288, 292, 298, 302, 306, 312, 318, 331, and 340 nm. Radiation at these wavelengths are absorbed by ozone, such that the difference between the incoming and outgoing radiation can be related to the amount of ozone in the atmosphere.\n\nThe SBUV consists of a double Ebert-Fastie spectrometer and a filter photometer similar to the BUV on Nimbus 4. The bandwidth of the photometer is about 3 nm and the spectral resolution for SBUV monochromator is 1.1 nm.",

    "title": "TRMM (TMPA) Precipitation L3 1 day 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V7 (TRMM_3B42_Daily) at GES DISC",
    "description": "TMPA (3B42_Daily) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG dataset (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/06).\n\nThis daily accumulated precipitation product is generated from the research-quality 3-hourly TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA (3B42). It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes. \n\nCounts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.\n\nEfforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format.\n\nThe information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.\n\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, accumulates first within the 3-hour period of the source data, and then continues to accumulate during the day. These values, however, can easily be converted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n",

    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Early* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHE and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL). \n\nIn the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \nPdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells.

    "description": "The Climate Hyperspectral Infrared Radiance Product (CHIRP) is a Level 1 radiance product derived from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on EOS-AQUA and the Cross-Track Infrared Sounders (CrIS) on the SNPP and JPSS-1+ platforms.  (JPSS-1 is also called NOAA-20). CHIRP provides a consistent spectral response function (SRF) across all instruments. Inter-instrument radiometric offsets are removed with SNPP-CrIS chosen as the \"standard\".  CHIRP follows the original instrument storage, i.e., granule in, granule out, and contains all information needed for retrievals (including cross-track, along-track, fov id, etc.). This version of CHIRP, SNDR13CHRP1, is the primary CHIRP product which provides a full radiance record from 2002 onwards starting with AIRS from September 1, 2002 to August 30, 2016, switching to the SNPP CrIS instrument on September 1, 2016.

The NMC data product includes temperature (Kelvin), humidity (%), geopotential height (m), and zonal and meridional wind components (m/s).\n\nGeopotential height and atmospheric temperature data are derived from two analysis systems: 1) tropospheric fields from 1000 to 100 mb, and 2) stratospheric analyses from 70 to 0.4 mb. The tropospheric fields are the 12 GMT gridded fields which are part of the Global Daily Assimilation System (GDAS), where data from radiosondes, aircraft, satellites, ships, bouys, or any other conventional means are assimilated and merged into meteorological fields (heights, temperature, winds). The stratospheric analyses are 12 GMT operational analyses at the 70 - 0.4 mb pressure levels produced from satellite temperature retrievals and RAOBS via a modified Cressman analysis. Tropospheric temperature analyses use combined NOAA-10 and NOAA-11 data. Moisture (northern hemisphere only) and Winds data are obtained from the NMC GDAS.\n\nThe gridded fields are on the standard 65 x 65 NMC polar stereographic grid oriented 80W (grid increment 381 km at 60N), and 100E (grid increment 381 km at 60S); Pole at (33,33). The NMC uses 18 standard pressure levels for data at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.4 millibars. Height and temperature data are produced at all 18 pressure levels from 1000 mb to 0.4 mb. Moisture data are only produced in the northern hemisphere for the 6 lowest altitude pressure levels. Wind data are produced for the 12 lowest altitude levels in the northern hemisphere, and at the 4 levels 1000, 500, 300, and 250 mb in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThere are four data files representing each subtype per day. Included in the NMC correlative data set will be a geographical data richness file. This file is used by the NMC access routines, and indicates the radiosonde coverage for each point on the NMC grid. The data files are available in a binary record oriented format.",

Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n",

CLDMSK_L2_VIIRS_NOAA20 is the shortname for the NOAA-20 VIIRS incarnation of the Cloud Mask continuity product derived from the MODIS-VIIRS cloud mask (MVCM) algorithm, which itself is based on the MODIS (MOD35) algorithm.  MVCM describes a continuity algorithm that is central to both MODIS data (from Terra and Aqua missions) and VIIRS data (from Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and Joint Polar Satellite System missions).  Please bear in mind that the term MVCM does not appear as an attribute within the product’s metadata.  Implemented to consistently handle MODIS and VIIRS inputs, the NOAA-20 VIIRS collection-1 products use calibration-adjusted NASA VIIRS L1B as inputs.  The nominal spatial resolution of the NOAA-20 VIIRS L2 Cloud mask is 750 meters.\r\n\r\nFor more information consult Product Page at: \r\nhttps://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/MVCM/",

The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture and temperature.  Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160 cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200 cm). \n\nThe Mosaic LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing \"File A\" files, and contains thirty-seven fields.

    "description": "TMPA (3B42RT_Daily) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG dataset (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDE/DAY/06; 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDL/DAY/06).\n\nThis daily accumulated precipitation product is generated from the Near Real-Time  3-hourly TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA (3B42RT). It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). Although the grid is from 60S to 60N, the high latitudes (beyond 50S/N) near real-time retrievals are considered very unreliable and thus are screened out from the daily accumulations. The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes.  \n\nCounts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.\n\nEfforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format. \n\nThe latency of this derived daily product is about 7 hours after the UTC day is closed. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.\n\nThe information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.\n\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 3-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n\n",

Hence, the gap-filled MOD16A2GF is the improved MOD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD16A2GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nProvided in the MOD16A2GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A2GF granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite period.

    "title": "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This data set contains the primary forcing hourly data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).\n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).\n\nThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).\n\nThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\". \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2.0 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n",

    "title": "NCEP/CPC L3 Half Hourly 4km Global (60S - 60N) Merged IR V1 (GPM_MERGIR) at GES DISC",
    "description": "These data originate from NOAA/NCEP.\n\nThe NOAA Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. It has been the intention to extend the record back to TRMM epoch, and some data are available from 1998. However, currently, the continuous record starts from February, 2000.\n\nThe leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).\n\nThe data contain  globally-merged (60S-60N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8).\n\nThe data have been corrected for \"zenith angle dependence\", i.e. IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects.  This correction allows for the merging of the IR data from the various geostationary satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at their boundaries.  Some residual differences among the data exist since the IR channels aboard the various spacecraft have slightly different characteristics and no intercalibration among the sensors has been performed. NOAA are in the process of performing such an intercalibration, although this effect is considerably smaller than the zenith angle effects. As well, parallax correction is applied, which shifts the geo-location of the GEO-IR footprints to approximately account for the cloud tops being displaced away from their actual geographic location when viewed along a slanted path.\n\n\nThe NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface. \n\n\nSimilarities with the original\n-----------------------------\nAs in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. \n\n\nDifferences from the original\n-----------------------------\n1. The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines. \n\n2. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South).\n\nThe data and time units are reflected in the corresponding \"units\" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude (\"lon\"), latitude (\"lat\") and \"time\" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple \"ncdump\" or \"h5dump\" command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n------------------\nThe creation of the original data at NOAA/NCEP is supported by funding from the NOAA Office of Global Programs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and by NASA via the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). \n\nThe permanent archive at GES DISC is supported by NASA's HQ Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program. \n\n\n",

This product is the AIRS mid-tropospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Level 3 Daily Gridded Retrieval, from the AIRS instrument on board of Aqua satellite. It is daily gridded data, at 2.5x2 deg (lon)x(lat) grid cell size. The data is in mole fraction units (data x 10^6 =ppm in volume). This is a total tropospheric column property. The file format is HDF-EOS 2.12 corresponding to HDF4. This AIRS mid-tropospheric CO2 Level 3 daily Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts as well as the latitude and longitude arrays giving the centers of the grid boxes. Each file covers a 24-hour period. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the individual CO2 retrievals which fall within that grid box over the period. The mid-tropospheric CO2 retrievals have been averaged and binned into 2.5 x 2 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -60.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean.",

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_CONV_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose OMAervation, background and analysis errors at OMAervation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate OMAervation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the OMAerving system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, OMAervation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the OMAerving system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an OMAervation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of OMAervation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given OMAervation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded OMAervation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

Version 3.5 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 7.3.\n\nThis data set is currently provided by the OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) Project. In expectation of the OCO-2 launch, the algorithm was developed by the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) Task as a preparatory project, using GOSAT TANSO-FTS spectra. After the OCO-2 launch,  \"ACOS\" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.\n\nThe \"ACOS\" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.\n\nThe GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA. These calibrated products are augmented by the OCO Project with additional geolocation information and further corrections. Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the \"ACOS\" Level 2 production process.\n\nEven though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings. \n\nElimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band. Users have to also carefully familiarize themselves with the disclaimer in the new documentation. \n\nAn important element to note are the updates on data screening. Although a Master Quality Flag is provided in the data product, further analysis of a larger set of data has allowed the science team to provide an updated set of screening criteria. These are listed in the data user's guide, and are recommended instead of the Master Quality Flag.\n\n\nLastly, users should continue to carefully observe and weigh information from three important flags:\n \n      \"warn_level\" - Provides a value that summarizes each sounding's acceptability to a larger set of quality filters. A high warn level predicts that the sounding would fail most data filters applied to it. A low warn level suggests that the sounding would pass most quality filters that might be applied. \n\n      \"sounding_qual_flag\" - quality of input data provided to the retrieval processing    \n\n      \"outcome_flag\" - retrieval quality based upon certain internal thresholds (not thoroughly evaluated)    \n\n      \"master_quality_flag\" - four possible values: \"Good\", \"Caution\" and \"Bad\", and \"Failed\", as determined from other flags in the L2 productThe short name for this data type is ACOS_L2S.",

The VIC model includes a two-layer energy balance snow model [Cherkauer et al., 2003]. \n\nDetails about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the VIC LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012).

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_CONV_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "This data set contains the secondary forcing hourly data \"File B\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format isnetCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).\n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  NLDAS-2 is providing a second forcing file, \"File B\", in which the surface temperature, humidity, and wind fields are represented not at 2-meters and 10-meters above the height of the NLDAS terrain, but rather at the same height above the NLDAS terrain as the height above the NARR terrain of the lowest prognostic level of the NARR assimilation system (namely, the same height above the model terrain as the lowest prognostic level of the mesoscale Eta model, which is the assimilating model in NARR). \n\nThe surface downward surface radiation field in \"File B\" is taken directly from NARR, without any bias correction.  The precipitation and convective precipitation fields in \"File B\" are also taken directly from NARR, and are used to calculate the convective fraction provided in \"File A\".  The aerodynamic conductance is \"File B\" is also taken from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File B\" is the secondary (optional) forcing file and contains ten meteorological forcing fields. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). ",

HIRDLS measured infrared emissions in 21 channels ranging from 6.12 to 17.76 microns in the upper troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. Data are available for the ~3 year mission from January 29, 2005 until March 17, 2008. Observations of the Earth's atmosphere were only made from the far azimuth scan (away from sun side) resulting in limited data coverage from +80 to -64 degrees latitude. The useful vertical range of the data depends on the measured species, and are provided on 24 levels per decade of pressure corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The current and final version of this product is 7. Of the original targeted species, only CH4 was not retrieved in this version.\n\nThe data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a single swath object with one day of data (measured species and species precision), geolocation fields (e.g. time, latitude, longitude, pressure), and swath attributes, along with file level metadata. Each file contains approximately 5600 profile scans.",

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.1 (GLDAS_NOAH10_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products. \n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_CONV_OMF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the OMAerving system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the OMAerving system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "This is the wide-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track. However, the original MYD05_L2 has data of 5- and 1-km pixels. Thus, MAC05S1 cross-track width is 41- and 201-pixels, depending on the parameter. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 atmospheric precipitable water product consists of total atmospheric column water vapor amounts (and ancillary parameters) over clear land areas of the globe, over extended clear oceanic areas with the Sun glint, and above clouds over both land and ocean. These estimates are based on a near-infrared algorithm using only daytime measurements with solar zenith angle less than 72 degrees. The retrieval algorithm relies on observations of water vapor attenuation of near-infrared solar radiation reflected by surfaces and clouds. The product is produced only over areas that have reflective surfaces in the near-infrared. The infrared-derived precipitable water vapor generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions as one component of another MODIS product (MYD07) is also provided as a part of this product. \n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC05S1).",

The AIRS Only Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

    "description": "The MOD16A3GF Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux (ET/LE) product is a year-end gap-filled yearly composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover.\n\nThe MOD16A3GF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MOD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD15A2H.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MOD16A3GF is the improved MOD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from yearly Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD16A3GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nProvided in the MOD16A3GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A3GF granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum for all days within the defined year, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all days within the defined year.\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) has been achieved for MODIS Evapotranspiration products.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR. \n\n",

This product is designed to take advantage of the synergy between OMI and MODIS, which both fly on satellites in the NASA A-Train constellation of Earth-observing satellites that follow similar orbital tracks and collect near-simultaneous observations. This product can be used for cloud-clearing, detection of multi-layered clouds, and other applications that may exploit these multi-spectral measurements.\n\nThe algorithm for the OMMYDCLD product co-locates daytime cloud parameters from MODIS onto the OMI visible (VIS) pixel for a given OMI orbit and generates statistical information from the collocated MODIS pixels. For each OMI granule, the orbit start and end times are used to select the corresponding 5-minute MODIS granules for processing. A contiguous list of MODIS granules spanning the full duration of the OMI orbit are selected based on the relative time lag between Aqua and Aura. The algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist Dr. Joanna Joiner.\n\nThe OMMYDCLD data files are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5) using the swath model, and follows the same conventions used by the other OMI Level-2 data products. Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (about 53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The file size for the OMMYDCLD data product is about 8 Mbytes.",

The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products: those derived from the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km), those derived from the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and those derived from the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. The Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV).",

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nECO3ETPTJPL Version 1 is a Level 3 (L3) product that provides evapotranspiration (ET) generated from data acquired by the ECOSTRESS radiometer instrument according to the Priestly-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/335/ECO3ETPTJPL_ATBD_V1.pdf). The ET product is generated from the Level 2 data products for surface temperature and emissivity, the Level 1 geolocation information, and a significant number of ancillary data inputs from other sources.  ET is set by various controls, including radiative and atmospheric demand, and environmental sensitivity, productivity, vegetation physiology, and phenology. PT-JPL is best utilized for natural ecosystems. The L3 ET product is used for creating the Level 4 products, Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) and Water Use Efficiency (WUE).\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ETPTJPL Version 1 data product contains layers of instantaneous ET, daily ET, canopy transpiration, soil evaporation, ET uncertainty, and interception evaporation. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data product, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree 3-hourly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 22, 2019.  The data product contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update. \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 0.25 x 0.25 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH025_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data product, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO2CLD Version 1 data product provides a cloud mask that can be used to determine cloud cover for the ECO1BRAD, ECO2LSTE, ECO3ETPTJPL, ECO4ESIPTJPL, and ECO4WUE data products. The ECOSTRESS Level 2 cloud product is derived using the five calibrated thermal bands in a multispectral cloud-conservative thresholding approach. The details of the algorithm are provided in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). The corresponding ECO1BGEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO1BGEO.001) data product is required to georeference the ECO2CLD data product.\r\n\r\nThe ECO2CLD Version 1 data product contains a single cloud mask layer. Information on how to interpret the bit fields in the cloud mask is provided in section 3.1 of the User Guide.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "Version 3.2 is the current version. Older versions have been superseded by Version 3.2.\n\nThe Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is the precipitation component of an internationally coordinated set of (mainly) satellite-based global products dealing with the Earth's water and energy cycles, under the auspices of the Global Water and Energy Experiment (GEWEX) Data and Assessment Panel (GDAP) of the World Climate Research Program.  As the follow on to the GPCP Version 2.X products, GPCP Version 3 (GPCP V3.2) seeks to continue the long, homogeneous precipitation record using modern merging techniques and input data sets.  The GPCPV3 suite currently consists the 0.5-degree monthly and daily products.  A follow-on 0.1-degree 3-hourly is expected.  All GPCPV3 products will be internally consistent. The monthly product spans 1983 - 2020. Inputs consist of the GPROF SSMI/SSMIS orbit files that are used to calibrate the PERSIANN-CDR IR-based precipitation in the span 60°N-S, which are in turn calibrated to the monthly 2.5-degree METH product.  The METH-GPROF-adjusted PERSIANN-CDR IR estimates are then climatologically adjusted to the blended TCC/MCTG.  Outside of 58°N-S, TOVS/AIRS estimates, adjusted climatologically to the MCTG, are used.  The PERSIANN-CDR / TOVS/AIRS estimates are then merged in the region 35°N-S-58°N-S, which are then merged with GPCC gauge analyses over land to obtain the final product. In addition to the final precipitation field, ancillary precipitation and error estimates are provided.",

Because the vertical information comes from a radiometer, it is not written out in independent vertical layers like the TRMM Precipitation Radar. Instead, the output is referenced to one of 100 typical structures for each hydrometeor or heating profile. These vertical structures are referenced as clusters in the output structure. Vertical hydrometeor profiles can be reconstructed to 28 layers by knowing the cluster number (i.e. shape) of the profile and a scale factor that is written for each pixel.\n\nThis product contains hydrometeor profiles of cloud liquid water, precipitation water, cloud ice water, precipitation ice, rainfall type, and latent heating in 28 atmospheric layers. \n\nChanges in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:\n\nPre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 760 km; Horizontal Resolution: 4.4 km \n\nPost-Boost (after 24 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 92.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 878 km; Horizontal Resolution: 5.1 km\n",

    "title": "Goddard Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent Fluxes, 1x1 deg Daily Grid, Set1 V2c (GSSTF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c (GSSTF2c) Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. \n\nGSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. \n\nGSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. \n\nThis is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. \n\nA finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3. \n\nThe GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15).

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 8-Day Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers an 8-day period, or one-half of the Aqua orbit repeat cycle. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 10 km cross-track. However, the original MYD05_L2 has data of 5- and 1-km pixels. Thus, MAC05S0 cross-track width is 3- and 11-pixels, depending on the parameter, and the resultant swath is about 15- and 10-km, correspondingly. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 atmospheric precipitable water product consists of total atmospheric column water vapor amounts (and ancillary parameters) over clear land areas of the globe, over extended clear oceanic areas with the Sun glint, and above clouds over both land and ocean. These estimates are based on a near-infrared algorithm using only daytime measurements with solar zenith angle less than 72 degrees. The retrieval algorithm relies on observations of water vapor attenuation of near-infrared solar radiation reflected by surfaces and clouds. The product is produced only over areas that have reflective surfaces in the near-infrared. The infrared-derived precipitable water vapor generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions as one component of another MODIS product (MYD07) is also provided as a part of this product. \n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC05S0).",

We apply TOMS ozone team  calibration techniques and consistent MEaSUREs SO2 (MS_SO2) algorithm, to obtain the best measurement-based ESDR of volcanic and anthropogenic SO2 masses and emissions. \n\nAs part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, the Goddard Earth Science (GES) Data and Information Data Center (DISC) has released a new SO2 Earth System Data Record (ESDR), TOMSN7SO2, re-processed using new 4 UV wavelength bands MS_SO2 algorithm that spans the full Nimbus 7 data period. TOMSN7SO2 is a Level 2 orbital swath product, which will be used to study the fifteen-year SO2 record from the Nimbus-7 TOMS and to expand the historical database of known volcanic eruptions.\n\n Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth s surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.\n",

The latency was about seven hours from the observation time, although processing issues may delay or prevent this schedule. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.\n\nEach file is a snapshot considered to represent the three-hour period centered on the \"nominal\" file time.  So, e.g., 00 UTC nominally represents the period from 2230 UTC of the previous day to 0130 UTC of the current day. Estimates outside the band 50 degree N-S are considered highly experimental. \n\nGES DISC initially receives these data from the Precipitation Processing System (PPS) in binary format.  However, before archiving, the data are scaled to real numbers, and re-arranged to a standard grid so that the first grid cell is at 180W, 60S. Thus formatted, data are stored  into CF-1.6 compliant netCDF-4 files and archived. This format is machine-independent, self-explanatory,  provides extremely efficient seamless compression, and gives various options for previewing the data without downloading it.\n\nApart from these technical differences, all other science content details remain the same, and users are strongly encouraged to read the provider's documentation that is linked to from here.",

The major V4.0 updates include: (1) use of a new daily and OMI ﬁeld of view speciﬁc geometry dependent surface Lambertian Equivalent Reﬂectivity (GLER) product in both NO2 and cloud retrievals; (2) use of improved cloud parameters (eﬀective cloud fraction and cloud optical centroid pressure) from a new cloud algorithm (OMCDO2N) that are retrieved consistently with NO2 using a new algorithm for O2-O2 slant column data and the GLER product for terrain reﬂectivity; (3) use of a more accurate terrain pressure calculated using OMI ground pixel-averaged terrain height and monthly mean GMI terrain pressure; and (4) improved treatment over snow/ice surfaces by using the concept of scene LER and scene pressure. The details can be found in the updated OMNO2 readme document (see Documentation). The OMNO2 product contains slant column NO2 (total amount along the average optical path from the sun into the atmosphere, and then toward the satellite), the total NO2 vertical column density (VCD), the stratospheric and tropospheric VCDs, air mass factors (AMFs), scattering weights for calculation of AMFs, and other ancillary data. The short name for the Level-2 swath type column NO2 products is OMNO2. Other OMNO2-associated NO2 products include the Level-2 gridded column product, OMNO2G, and the Level-3 gridded column product, OMNO2d.\n\nThe OMNO2 files are stored in version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each Level-2 file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMNO2 is ~24 MB.",

    "title": "OMPS/NPP PCA SO2 Total Column 1-Orbit L2 Swath 50x50km V2 (OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 product is part of the MEaSUREs (Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments) suite of products.\n\nIt is retrieved from the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir Mapper (NM) spectrometer and provides contiguous daily global monitoring of anthropogenic and volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2), an important pollutant and aerosol precursor that affects both air quality and the climate. The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017), and continues (Zhang et al., 2017) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) standard Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument SO2 product (OMSO2). \n\nThe latest OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product uses new Jacobian lookup tables and more realistic model based a priori profiles in anthropogenic SO2 retrievals. This helps to more accurately account for the pixel-to-pixel variation in SO2 sensitivity due to different factors such as the vertical distribution of SO2, solar and viewing angles, surface reflectivity, and cloudiness. As compared with the previous OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V1.2 product that assumes the same SO2 sensitivity for all OMPS pixels, the new V2 anthropogenic SO2 retrievals have reduced retrieval biases especially over background regions (see Figure 1 for an example). The same updated PCA SO2 retrieval algorithm (Li et al., 2020) is also used to produce the recently released OMSO2 V2 product (doi:10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022). The new OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product thus offers enhanced consistency between the NASA EOS standard (OMI) and continuity (OMPS) SO2 data records\n\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth's surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.",

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.",

The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 10 km cross-track. However, the original MYD06_L2 has data of 5- and 1-km pixels.

Each data file contains a days worth of ozone measurements, and is written in an ASCII text format.\n\nThe SBUV/2 is a scanning double monochromator and a cloud cover radiometer (CCR) designed to measure ultraviolet (UV) spectral intensities. In its primary mode of operation, the monochromator measures solar radiation backscattered by the atmosphere in 12 discrete wavelength bands in the near-UV, ranging from 252.0 to 339.8 nanometers, each with a bandpass of 1.1 nm. The total-ozone algorithm uses the four longest wavelength bands (312.5, 317.5, 331.2 and 339.8 nm), whereas the profiling algorithm uses the shorter wavelengths. The cloud cover radiometer operates at 379 nm (i.e., outside the ozone absorption band) with a 3.0 nm bandpass and was designed to measure the reflectivity of the surface in the IFOV. The SBUV/2 also makes periodic measurements of the solar flux by deploying a diffuser plate into the FOV to reflect sunlight into the measurement.",

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

DSR is incident solar radiation over land surfaces in the shortwave spectrum (300-4,000 nanometers) and is an important variable in land-surface models that address a variety of scientific and application issues. The MCD18 products are based on a prototyping algorithm that uses multi-temporal signatures of MODIS data to derive surface reflectance and then calculate incident DSR using the look-up table (LUT) approach. The LUTs consider different types of loadings of aerosols and clouds at a variety of illumination/viewing geometry. Global DSR products are generated from MODIS and geostationary satellite data. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/106/MCD18_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nProvided in the MOD18A1 product are layers for instantaneous DSR array for each individual MODIS overpass and 3-hour DSR array along with a View Zenith Angle layer.\n\nValidation at stage 1 ( https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Surface Radiation products.

Meteorological fields from the WRF model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the \"receptor\" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a \"footprint\" field. The footprint, with units of mixing ratio  per surface flux, quantifies the influence of upwind surface fluxes on greenhouse gas concentrations measured at the receptor and is computed by counting the number of particles in a surface-influenced volume and the time spent in that volume. For each column observation location, the receptors are located at 14 discrete vertical levels throughout the atmospheric column.  The CMS program is designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The System uses NASA observations and modeling/analysis capabilities to establish the accuracy, quantitative uncertainties, and utility of products for supporting national and international policy, regulatory, and management activities.

    "description": "This is the wide-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track. Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the crosss-track width of the subset geolocations is 41 pixels. The subset Cloud Mask has 201 pixels across-track. However, some of the Cloud Mask information is at bit level, thus allowing storing actually 250-m information in seemingly 1-km pixels. This is achieved by reserving 2 bytes (the last two out of six) of every 1-km pixel as 16 yes/no-cloud bits. Each one of these 16 bits flags a corresponding 250-m tile inside the 1-km pixel. Their state is described in the local attributes to the Cloud_Mask HDF data set, and accordingly must be interprated as 0=YES, 1=NO. Thus the effective cross-track width, for these two bytes only, is 804 tiles of 250-m denomination. \n      \nAlong-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the  visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality. The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel (paulm@ssec.wisc.edu).\n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC35S1).",

    "title": "GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "\nVersion 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH.  The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before \"07\", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared and rain gauge  dataset, variable \"precipitation\",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global \"precipitation\" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable \"MWprecipitation\", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version \"07\", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThe latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. \n\n\n\nThe daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]} / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]\n\nWhere:\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nPi              - half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of half-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\nPdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables \"precipitation_cnt\" and \"MWprecipitation_cnt\", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThere are various ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error (variable \"randomError\"). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the squared half-hourly \"randomError\"  for the day is computed, and the resulting (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result in (mm/day):\n\nPerr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err  * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_i\t\t- half-hourly input, \"randomError\", (mm/hr)\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily error, (mm/day)\nNcnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimates\n\nAgain, the sum of squared \"randomError\" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.\n",

    "title": "Aqua/AIRS L3 Daily Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS+AMSU) 1 degree x 1 degree V7.0 at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. The value for each grid box is the sum of the values that fall within the 1x1 area divided by the number of points in the box. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.\n\nThe MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution.

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ECO4ESIALEXI Version 1 data product provides the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), which is computed from clear-sky estimates of the relative daily evapotranspiration (ET) fraction: ESI = ET/ETo, where ET is ETdaily from the ECOSTRESS Level 3 product and ETo is the reference ET. A description of the major components of the ECOSTRESS algorithm implemented in Version 1 of the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI) ESI code is provided in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1002/ECO4ESIALEXI_ATBD_V1.pdf).

A low-resolution browse is also available showing daily ESI as a stretched image with a color ramp in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach, only TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are the same as before, but the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the individual CO2 retrievals which fall within that grid box over the month. The mid-tropospheric CO2 retrievals have been averaged and binned into 2.5 x 2 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -60.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean.",

Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI SO2 from ultraviolet spectral measurements is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The relevant information of absorption cross section, instrument characteristics, cloud cover, and geolocation are utilized to derive SO2 slant column density (SCD). A sensitive spectral window of 312 to 326 nm is set as the baseline for the slant column fit with another two spectral windows (325 to 335 nm, 360 to 390 nm) to account for the non-linear effects in those high column amount cases. The SCD is then corrected with the empirical offsets to the systematic biases. The air mass factor (AMF) Look-up table has been created with the LIDORT radiative transfer model. The outputs of the DOAS algorithm are SO2 vertical column density (VCD), SCD, AMF, the DOAS-type averaging kernels (AK), and error estimates.",

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH10_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data product, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STD. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

    "description": "This is the narrow-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 10 km cross-track. Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the crosss-track width of the subset geolocations is 3 pixels. The subset Cloud Mask has 11 pixels across-track. However, some of the Cloud Mask information is at bit level, thus allowing storing actually 250-m information in seemingly 1-km pixels. This is achieved by reserving 2 bytes (the last two out of six) of every 1-km pixel as 16 yes/no-cloud bits. Each one of these 16 bits flags a corresponding 250-m tile inside the 1-km pixel. Their state is described in the local attributes to the Cloud_Mask HDF data set, and accordingly must be interprated as 0=YES, 1=NO. Thus the effective cross-track width, for these two bytes only, is 44 tiles of 250-m denomination.\n      \nAlong-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved. \n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the  visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality. The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel (paulm@ssec.wisc.edu).\n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC35S0).",

    "description": "This is the new (GPM-formated) TRMM product. It replaces the old TRMM_2A12\n Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)\n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n",

    "description": "This version has been superseded by Version 3.2 (DOI: 10.5067/MEASURES/GPCP/DATA304).\n\nThe Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is the precipitation component of an internationally coordinated set of (mainly) satellite-based global products dealing with the Earth's water and energy cycles, under the auspices of the Global Water and Energy Experiment (GEWEX) Data and Assessment Panel (GDAP) of the World Climate Research Program.  As the follow on to the GPCP Version 2.X products, GPCP Version 3 (GPCP V3.1) seeks to continue the long, homogeneous precipitation record using modern merging techniques and input data sets.  The GPCPV3 suite currently consists the 0.5-degree monthly.  Additional products are planned, namely a 0.5° daily product for the entire record from 1983 to the (delayed) present and a 0.1° 3-hourly product from 1998 to the (delayed) present. All GPCPV3 products will be internally consistent.  The monthly product spans 1983 - 2019. Inputs consist of the GPROF SSMI/SSMIS orbit files that are used to calibrate the PERSIANN-CDR IR-based precipitation in the span 60°N-S.  Outside of 58°N-S, TOVS/AIRS estimates, calibrated by the IR estimates and the GPCC gauge analyses are used.  This satellite-only estimate is then merged with GPCC gauge analyses over land to compute the final product. In addition to the final precipitation field, ancillary precipitation and error estimates are provided.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

The surface reference technique rests on the assumption that the difference between the measurements of the normalized surface cross section outside and within the rain provides an estimate of the PIA. The secondary purpose of 2A21 is to compute the normalized radar cross sections (\"sigma-not\" or Normalized Radar Cross-Sectin (NRTS)) of the surface under rain-free conditions. \n\nMain objectives of 2A23 are as follows:\n(a) Detection of bright band (BB) and determination of the height of BB, the\nstrength of BB, and the width (i.e. thickness) of BB when BB exists.\n(b) Classification of rain type into the following three categories:\n- stratiform,\n - convective,\n - other,\nwhere \"other\" means (ice) cloud only and/or maybe noise.\n (c) Detection of shallow isolated and shallow non-isolated.\n (d) Output of Rain/No-rain flag.\n (e) Computation of the estimated height of freezing level.\n (f) Output of the height of storm top. \n\nThe objectives of 2A25 are to correct for the rain attenuation in measured radar reflectivity (Zm) and to estimate the instantaneous three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data. The estimated vertical profiles of attenuation-corrected radar reflectivity factor (Ze) and rainfall rate (R) are given at each resolution cell of the PR.

    "description": "The MYD16A3GF Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux (ET/LE) product is a year-end gap-filled yearly composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The improved algorithm is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover.\n\nThe MYD16A3GF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MYD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD15A2H.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MYD16A3GF is the improved MYD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MYD16A3GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nProvided in the MYD16A3GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MYD16A3GF granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum for all days within the defined year, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all days within the defined year.\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) has been achieved for MODIS Evapotranspiration products.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Changes\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR.\n",

This level-2 global total column ozone product (OMTO3) is based on the enhanced TOMS version-8 algorithm that essentially uses the ultraviolet radiance data at 317.5 and 331.2 nm. OMI hyper-spectral measurements help in the corrections for the factors that induce uncertainty in ozone retrievals (e.g., cloud and aerosol, sea-glint effects, profile shape sensitivity, SO2 and other trace gas contamination). In addition to the total ozone values this product also contains some auxiliary derived and ancillary input parameters including N-values, effective Lambertian scene-reflectivity, UV aerosol index, SO2 index, cloud fraction, cloud pressure, ozone below clouds, terrain height, geolocation, solar and satellite viewing angles, and quality flags. The shortname for this Level-2 OMI total column ozone product is OMTO3. The algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist  Dr. Pawan K. Bhartia.\n\nThe OMTO3 files are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes).

Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe TROPOMI UV Aerosol Index has been calculated based on wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where ozone absorption is weak. A residual value is calculated from measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and per-calculated theoretical reflectance for a Rayleigh scattering-only atmosphere given a wavelength pair.

In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: \n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. \n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ECO3ETALEXI Version 1 data product provides estimates of daily evapotranspiration (ET) using the ECOSTRESS Level 2 (L2) land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&amp;E) product, along with ancillary meteorological data and remotely sensed vegetation cover information. The ECO3ETALEXI data product is derived using a physics-based surface energy balance (SEB) algorithm, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI). Described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1000/ECO3ETALEXI_ATBD_V1.pdf), DisALEXI is based on spatial disaggregation of regional-scale fluxes from the ALEXI SEB model. There are many approaches for spatially mapping ET; however, SEB methods are favored for remote sensing retrievals based on land-surface temperature. ALEXI was initially developed for managed landscapes and has now been evaluated in comparison with micrometeorological flux tower observations over crop, forest, grassland, wetland, and semiarid desert sites. Applications include crop water use, crop phenology monitoring, and drought early warning or water stress detection. ECO3ETALEXI is available for CONUS at 70-meter (m) pixel resolution.\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ETALEXI Version 1 data product contains layers of daily ET, ET uncertainty, and associated quality flags. A low-resolution browse is also available showing daily ET as a stretched image with a color ramp in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach, only TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are the same as before, but the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files). \n\nThe NLDAS-2 monthly primary forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data, as monthly accumulation for total precipitation, convective precipitation, and potential evaporation, and monthly average for other variables. The convective precipitation monthly total is the hourly convective fraction multiplied by the hourly precipitation (both from the NLDAS-2 \"File A\" files), and then summed over all hours of the month. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month. The one exception to this is the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for the monthly accumulated  precipitation and convective precipitation that both start from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. \n\nThe monthly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields.

    "description": "Version 10r is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 10r.\n\nIn early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. The OCO-2 project uses the LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to the Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectral elements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.This product is the output from the Level 1B process. It converts the raw instrument data numbers into calibrated radiances. This conversion is based upon files of instrument characteristics and algorithm parameters that may vary over time. In addition to calibrated radiances, the Level 1B output products have geolocation information recorded for each measurement for use in higher-level processes.\n\nThis is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMND) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-12 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products in the netCDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.

    "description": "Starting from August 6th in 2019, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI along-track high spatial resolution (~5.5km at nadir) has been implemented.\nFor data before August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__CH4____1 data collection.\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI methane product is a physics based method that uses the Oxygen-A band (760 nm) and absorption bands in shortwave infrared spectrum. In Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI methane algorithm, the atmosphere forward model simulates the absorbing gas (oxygen, methane, water vapor, and carbon monoxide) optical properties, as well as aerosol optical properties with size distribution, refractive index, and number concentration. The inversion is performed based on the forward calculation, the measurement, and the prior information. Cloud filtering is critical in methane retrieval, S5P methane algorithm applies re-gridded Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud mask data. Additional cloud filters based on S5P/TROPOMI measurements and the FRESCO apparent surface pressure will be applied when VIIRS cloud data are not available. Other current data filters in the retrieval algorithm include land-only pixels (excluding mountainous areas), spectrum intensity, solar zenith angle and instrument zenith angle. \n\nThe S5P/TROPOMI methane retrieval is for non-time-critical (NTC) data stream only, and its main outputs include the column averaged dry air mixing ratio of methane, the random error, and the biased corrected dry air methane fraction data based on the retrieved surface albedo. \n\nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the methane product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).\n\nThe data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.",

    "description": "Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.\n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.  \n\n",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX2SUP. It is a new product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "The mass concentration ammonia in the atmosphere, consists of products generated for the study of atmospheric ammonia. Atmospheric ammonia is an important component of the global nitrogen cycle. In the troposphere, ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric and nitric to form fine particulate matter. These ammonium containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei. Major sources of atmospheric ammonia involve agricultural activities including animal husbandry, especially concentrated animal feeding operations and fertilizer use. Major sinks of atmospheric ammonia involve dry deposition and wet removal by precipitation, as well as conversion to particulate ammonium by reaction with acids. Measurements of ambient NH3 are sparse, but satellites provide a means to monitor atmospheric composition globally. Using the AIRS/AMSU satellite this algorithm provides monthly measurements of derived atmospheric NH3 for September 2002 through August 2016.",

Each data file is yearly by variable with 12 monthly time steps and covers the same period of record as the Daymet V4 R1 daily data. The monthly climatology files are derived from the larger datasets of daily weather parameters produced on a 1 km x 1 km grid for North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Separate monthly files are provided for the land areas of continental North America (Canada, the United States, and Mexico), Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Data are distributed in standardized Climate and Forecast (CF)-compliant netCDF (*.nc) and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) formats. In Version 4 R1 (ver 4.4), all 2020 and 2021 files (60 total) were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 R1 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs.

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP10_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder).

    "description": "\nWARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.         END OF WARNING.\n\n\n\nThe AIRS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) product (AIRIBRAD_NRT_005) differs from the routine product (AIRIBRAD_005) in 2 ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude.

Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.\n\nThe MERRA-Land product, MSTUNXMLD or tavgU_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional diurnal at the native resolution.

    "description": "The CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS in combination with the AMSU constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\nWARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 48.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/48.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files.

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-10 02 (TOVSAMNG) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 10r.\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory -3 (OCO-3) was deployed to the International Space Station in May, 2019. It is technically a single instrument, almost identical to OCO-2.\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere.\n\nOCO-3 incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. \n\nOxygen-A Band cloud screening algorithm is one of the primary cloud screening tools implemented in the operational OCO processing pipeline. The algorithm was introduced and applied to early GOSAT data  with further analysis performed on OCO-2 simulations.\n\nThe OCO ABO2 algorithm employs a fast Bayesian retrieval to estimate surface pressure and surface albedo from high resolution spectra of the molecular oxygen (O2) A-band, near 0.765 µm. The radiative transfer forward model (FM) assumes a clear-sky condition, i.e. Rayleigh scattering only, such that differences between the modeled and measured radiances are apparent when the measurement scene contains cloud or aerosol. \n\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUB_NOAA16_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to the Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectral elements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.This product is the output from the Level 1B process. It converts the raw instrument data numbers into calibrated radiances. This conversion is based upon files of instrument characteristics and algorithm parameters that may vary over time. In addition to calibrated radiances, the Level 1B output products have geolocation information recorded for each measurement for use in higher-level processes.\n\nThis is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSADNG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AIRS_AQUA_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI aerosol layer height algorithm applies a forward model, which includes DISAMAR (Determining Instrument Specifications and Analyzing Methods for Atmospheric Retrieval, a Layer-Based Orders of Scattering algorithm) to calculate monochromatic reflectance, and also employs a neural network scheme for speedy processor performance. Data retrieval uses the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM) for spectral fitting with various aerosol layer pressures and aerosol optical thicknesses in the Oxygen-A band (758 -770nm). The aerosol baseline model assumes a single uniformly distributed aerosol layer with a fixed pressure thickness and a constant aerosol volume extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo. The aerosol parameterization is particularly suitable for elevated non-scattering aerosols such as volcanic ash, desert dust and biomass burning plume. The product main outputs include the mid-pressure and mid-altitude of aerosol layers, aerosol optical thickness at 760nm, error estimates, and other relevant diagnostics.\n\nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the aerosol layer height product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).",

The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The most recent 7 days of data are available online. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 degrees to +82 degrees latitude), with each profile spaced 1.5 degrees or ~165 km along the orbit track (roughly 15 orbits per day). The vertical coverage is from 215 to 0.1 hPa.\n\nThe MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the Earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT User Guide and the MLS L2 Data Quality Document for Standard Products.",

    "description": "Version 9r is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 9r.\n\nThis data set is currently provided by the OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) Project. In expectation of the OCO-2 launch, the algorithm was developed by the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) Task as a preparatory project, using GOSAT TANSO-FTS spectra. After the OCO-2 launch,  \"ACOS\" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.\n\nThe \"ACOS\" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.\n\nThe GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA. These calibrated products are augmented by the OCO Project with additional geolocation information and further corrections. Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the \"ACOS\" Level 2 production process.\n\nEven though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings. \n\nElimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band. Users have to also carefully familiarize themselves with the disclaimer in the new documentation. \n\nAn important element to note are the updates on data screening. Although a Master Quality Flag is provided in the data product, further analysis of a larger set of data has allowed the science team to provide an updated set of screening criteria. These are listed in the data user's guide, and are recommended instead of the Master Quality Flag.\n\n\nLastly, users should continue to carefully observe and weigh information from three important flags:\n \n\n      \"sounding_qual_flag\" - quality of input data provided to the retrieval processing    \n\n      \"outcome_flag\" - retrieval quality based upon certain internal thresholds (not thoroughly evaluated)    \n\n        ",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP13_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar IFOV for each swath. This is a single-frequency retrieval that relies on Ka-band data only. While the 2ADPR dual-frequency retrieval should give better overall estimates, that algorithm requires co-aligned Ku-band data. This 2AKa product will be produced independently and would not be impacted by any operational issues with the Ku-band radar.

For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n",

The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

There are two grid resolutions: 5.0 degrees and 25 kms. For each grid box, the core statistics are the number of measurements, mean, and standard deviation. Most variables are also conditioned on surface type and precipitation type with other three-dimensional fields adding the height above the ellipsoid. Unless otherwise specified, the means are conditioned on precipitation being present (rain rate &gt; 0). For the daily product, the mean square statistic is saved rather than the standard deviation. In addition to the daily and monthly products is a simplified joint daily product that contains a subset of the fields from the full daily product.",

The vertical coverage is from 215 to 0.001 hPa.\n\nThe MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the Earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT User Guide and the MLS L2 Data Quality Document for Standard Products.",

There are two Level-2 Aura OMI aerosol products OMAERO and OMAERUV. The OMAERUV product uses the near-UV algorithm. The OMAERO (13x24 km resolution) and OMAEROZ (13x12 km resolution) is based on the multi-wavelength algorithm that uses up to 20 wavelength bands between 331 nm and 500 nm. The multi-wavelength retrieval algorithm is developed by the KNMI OMI Team Scientists. Drs. Deborah Stein-Zweers, Martin Sneep and Pepijn Veefkind are now the key investigators of this product. The OMAEROZ products contain Aerosol Optical Depths, Single Scattering Albedo, Aerosol Type, Aerosol Layer Height, and other intermediate and ancillary parameters and geolocation information.\n\nThe OMAEROZ files are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). OMAEROZ data files are based on Zoomed Level 1B radiance observations which are made once a month. Thus there is one day of zoomed data (approximately 14 orbits) per month. The maximum file size for the OMAEROZ data is about 11 Mbytes.\n\nA Readme document containing brief algorithm description and known data quality related issues and file specifications are provided by the OMAERO Algorithm lead.",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI aerosol layer height algorithm applies a forward model, which includes DISAMAR (Determining Instrument Specifications and Analyzing Methods for Atmospheric Retrieval, a Layer-Based Orders of Scattering algorithm) to calculate monochromatic reflectance, and also employs a neural network scheme for speedy processor performance. Data retrieval uses the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM) for spectral fitting with various aerosol layer pressures and aerosol optical thicknesses in the Oxygen-A band (758 -770nm). The aerosol baseline model assumes a single uniformly distributed aerosol layer with a fixed pressure thickness and a constant aerosol volume extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo. The aerosol parameterization is particularly suitable for elevated non-scattering aerosols such as volcanic ash, desert dust and biomass burning plume. The product main outputs include the mid-pressure and mid-altitude of aerosol layers, aerosol optical thickness at 760nm, error estimates, and other relevant diagnostics.\n\nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the aerosol layer height product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder).

The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb.

The subset is processed at the Modeling and Assimilation Data and Information Services Center (MDISC) of the GES DISC, NASA. The algorithm first calculates coordinates along the CloudSat ground track as well as coordinates orthogonal to the CloudSat ground track to produce a swath co-instantiated with actual CloudSat coverage. The algorithm proceeds to extract the closest MERRA grid cell at each point within the co-instantiated swath and writes the output subset in HDF-EOS2 swath-format, one subset for each time stride for eight subsets per day. The swath has an along-track temporal resolution of 10 seconds and an across-track spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. With 9 across-track bins, the resulting coverage is about 200km wide.\n\nAll original parameters are preserved in the subset. As it is collocated with CloudSat, the subset is automatically collocated with CALIPSO as well.\n    ",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n.\n\nThis is environmental data that includes the profiles of atmospheric parameters assumed in the L2 retrieval algorithm.\n\nThis GPM data type provides single- and dual-frequency-derived precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products derived from the: \n+ the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km);\n+ the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and\n+ the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. \n\nThe Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV). \n\nThe dual-frequency retrieval benefits from having co-aligned measurements at Ku- and Ka-bands. Data from these measurements are used to infer properties of the particle size distribution, which are expected to lead to improved estimates of rainfall rate and equivalent liquid water content. Dual-frequency data are expected to improve the capability to discriminate among water, ice, and mixed-phase hydrometeors as a function of height. This capability is particularly important in convective storms where a bright-band signature, associated with mixed-phase hydrometeors, is usually not detectable. In addition, the different attenuation rates of the Ku- and Ka-bands allow differential attenuation techniques to be used to estimate the path integrated attenuation. The high-sensitivity Ka-band channel is expected to have 6 dB greater sensitivity than the Ku- and standard Ka-band channels and to provide enhanced detection capabilities at the light rainfall rates.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\n   The 2AKa algorithm provides precipitation estimates from the Ka radar of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar on the core GPM spacecraft. The product contains two swaths of data corresponding to the scans of the Ka radar. The first swath contains matched scans (MS), which are intended to be co-aligned with the Ku-band instantaneous fields of view (IFOV). The second swath contains the high-sensitivity scans (HS), which are interleaved between the Ku/Ka-MS swaths. Both swaths are narrow and centered within the interior of the Ku swath. This is a single-frequency retrieval of precipitation; no information from the Ku radar is used. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar IFOV for each swath.\n\t\n   This is a single-frequency retrieval that relies on Ka-band data only. While the dual-frequency retrieval should give better overall estimates, that algorithm requires co-aligned Ku-band data. This 2AKa product will be produced independently and would not be impacted by any operational issues with the Ku-band radar. The high sensitivity to smaller hydrometeors should result in precipitation estimates in lighter precipitation then the Ku-only data.\n\n   It is important to note the difference between the single- and the dual-frequency (DF) algorithms. While this 2AKa dataset is a single-frequency retrieval, the DF algorithm employs both KuPR and KaPR L1B standard products as inputs. The DF algorithm cannot be executed unless both L1B products are available. Pixels observed by DPR can be categorized into three types: pixels in the inner swath of normal scans (observed both by KuPR and KaPR), pixels in the outer swath of normal scans (observed only by KuPR), and pixels in the interleaved scans (observed only by KaPR in the high-sensitivity mode). The KuPR algorithm is executed for pixels in both inner and outer swaths of normal scans. The KaPR algorithm is executed for pixels in the inner swath of normal scans and in the interleaved scans. The DF algorithm is executed for pixels of all the three kinds.\n\n",

In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUB_NOAA17_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-11 02 (TOVSAMNH) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNH) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-11 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid. For this NOAA-11 satellite the downlink of data was turned off in mid-1994 then reactivated in 1997. Therefore there is a gap in the monthly data products.",

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set,  GLDAS-2.0 VIC monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n\n\n",

This product is similar to AIRX3STM. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MON_CONV_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the OMAerving system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the OMAerving system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe TROPOMI Carbon Monoxide total column applies a modified SWIR CO retrieval (SICOR) algorithm based on the CO absorption band between 2305 nm and 2385 nm. The S5P SICOR algorithm accounts for cloudy and aerosol loaded atmosphere conditions and is suitable for clear sky observations over land and cloudy observations over both land and oceans.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nAll 1C products have a common L1C data structure, simple and generic. Each L1C swath includes scan time, latitude and longitude, scan status, quality, incidence angle, Sun glint angle, and the intercalibrated brightness temperature (Tc). One or more swaths are included in a product. The radiometer data are recalibrated to a common basis so that precipitation products derived from them are consistent. 1CSSMIS contains common calibrated brightness temperature from the SSMIS passive microwave instruments flown on the DMSP satellites. Swath S1 has 3 low frequency channels (19V 19H 22V). Swath S2 has 2 low frequency channels (37V 37H). Swath S3 has 4 high frequency channels (150H 183+/-1H 183+/-3H 183+/-7H). S4 has 2 high frequency channels (91V 91H). All the above frequencies are in GHz. Earth observations for all four swaths are taken during a 144o segment of the instrument rotation when SSMIS scans in the direction of foreward satellite motion. We define the spacecraft vector (v) at the center of this segment.",

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

SCAMS was designed to map tropospheric temperature profiles, water vapor abundance, and cloud water content to be used for weather prediction even in the presence of clouds, which block conventional satellite infrared sensors. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from 9-track magnetic tapes. The data are archived in their original IBM 32-bit word binary record format, also referred to as a binary TAP file, and contain one orbit of measurements.                         \n\nThe SCAMS experiment on Nimbus-6 is a follow on to the successful Nimbus-5 NEMS experiment.  SCAMS continuously monitored emitted microwave radiation at frequencies of 22.235, 31.65, 52.85, 53.85 and 55.45 GHz. The three channels near the 5.0-mm oxygen absorption band were used primarily to deduce atmospheric temperature profiles. The two channels near 10 mm permitted water vapor and cloud water content over calm oceans to be estimated separately. The instrument, a Dicke-superheterodyne type, scanned +/- 45 degrees normal to the orbital plane with a 10 degree field of view. The three oxygen channels shared common signal and reference antennas. Both water vapor channels had their own signals and reference antennas. The absolute rms accuracy of the oxygen channels was better than 2 Kelvin and that of the water vapor channels better than 1 Kelvin.                               \nThe SCAMS Principal Investigator was Prof. David H.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration.

A single time-independent site-specific Air-Mass Factor (AMF) value for each site was calculated (McLinden et al., 2014) and applied consistently to each satellite SCD dataset to derive SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs=SCDs/AMFs). The emission estimate method is based on a fit of satellite VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution near emission point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially with distance and that they are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a two-dimensional (2D) exponentially modified Gaussian function. The total SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the annual emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.",

    "description": "This is a CloudSat-collocated subset of the original product OMSO2, for the purposes of the A-Train mission.  The goal of the subset is to select and return OMI data that are within +/-100 km across the CloudSat track. The resultant OMI subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track of CloudSat. Even though collocated with CloudSat, this subset can serve many other A-Train applications.\n\n(The shortname for this CloudSat-collocated subset of the original product OMSO2 Product is OMSO2_CPR_V003)\n            \nThis document describes the original OMI SO2 product (OMSO2) produced from global mode UV measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). OMI was launched on July 15, 2004 on the EOS Aura satellite, which is in a sun-synchronous ascending polar orbit with 1:45pm local equator crossing time. The data collection started on August 17, 2004 (orbit 482) and continues to this day with only minor data gaps. The minimum SO2 mass detectable by OMI is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the detection threshold of the legacy Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) SO2 data (1978-2005) [Krueger et al 1995]. This is due to smaller OMI footprint and the use of wavelengths better optimized for separating O3 from SO2.\n\nThe product file, called a data granule, covers the sunlit portion of the orbit with an approximately 2600 km wide swath containing 60 pixels per viewing line. During normal operations, 14 or 15 granules are produced daily, providing fully contiguous coverage of the globe. Currently, OMSO2 products are not produced when OMI goes into the \"zoom mode\" for one day every 452 orbits (~32 days). For each OMI pixel we provide 4 different estimates of the column density of SO2 in Dobson Units (1DU=2.69x10^16 molecules/cm2) obtained by making different assumptions about the vertical distribution of the SO2. However, it is important to note that in most cases the precise vertical distribution of SO2 is unimportant. The users can use either the SO2 plume height, or the center of mass altitude (CMA) derived from SO2 vertical distribution, to interpolate between the 4 values: \n\n1)Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) SO2 column (ColumnAmountSO2_PBL), corresponding to CMA of 0.9 km.\n2)Lower tropospheric SO2 column (ColumnAmountSO2_TRL), corresponding to CMA of 2.5 km.\n3)Middle tropospheric SO2 column, (ColumnAmountSO2_TRM), usually produced by volcanic degassing, corresponding to CMA of 7.5 km,  \n4)Upper tropospheric and Stratospheric SO2 column (ColumnAmountSO2_STL), usually produced by explosive volcanic eruption, corresponding to CMA of 17 km. \n\nThe accuracy and precision of the derived SO2 columns vary significantly with the SO2 CMA and column amount, observational geometry, and slant column ozone. OMI becomes more sensitive to SO2 above clouds and snow/ice, and less sensitive to SO2 below clouds. Preliminary error estimates are discussed below (see Data Quality Assessment). \n\nOMSO2 files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format\n(HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an\norbit (53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The\nmaximum file size for the OMSO2 data product is about 9 Mbytes.",

    "title": "Aqua/AIRS L3 Monthly Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS+AMSU+HSB) 1 degree x 1 degree V7.0 at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STM. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThis product contains the calibrated received power from the Ka-band of the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) aboard the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.\n\nOne of the reasons for adding the Ka-band frequency (35.5 GHz) channel to the DPR is to provide information on the drop-size distribution that can be obtained from non-Rayleigh scattering effects at the higher frequency. Another reason for the new Ka-band channel is to provide more accurate estimates of the phase-transition height in precipitating systems. This information is very important not only in increasing the accuracy of rain rate estimation by the DPR itself, but in improving rain estimation by passive microwave radiometers.\n\nThe Ka-band Radar has a more complex scanning geometry, defined by two modes: Matched (MS) and High-sensitivity (HS). In the first type of scan (MS), the Ka Radar beams are matched to the central 25 beams of the Ku Radar, providing a swath of 120 km (within the 245km swath of the Ku Radar). In the second type of scan (HS), the Ka is operated in the high-sensitivity mode to detect light rain and snow.  In this case, its beams are interlaced within the matched scan pattern, resulting in 49 cross-track beams which, however, still cover the 120-km swath.  \n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSU_NOAA14_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Level 2 Near Real Time (NRT) Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) product (AIRS2RET_NRT_006) differs from the routine product (AIRS2RET_006) in four ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude, (3) if the forecast surface pressure is unavailable, a surface climatology is used, and (4) no ice cloud properties retrievals are performed. The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. Estimates of the errors associated with these quantities is also part of the Standard Product. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 28 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at 14 atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 50 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240\ngranules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth’s arid dust source regions. EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and uses imaging spectroscopy to take measurements of the sunlit regions of interest between 52° N latitude and 52° S latitude. An interactive map showing the locations of methane plumes along with metadata, regions being investigated, current and forecasted data coverage, and additional data resources can be found on the VSWIR Imaging Spectroscopy Interface for Open Science (VISIONS) EMIT Open Data Portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its primary objective described above, EMIT has demonstrated the capacity to characterize methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) point-source emissions by measuring gas absorption features in the short-wave infrared bands. The EMIT Level 2B Greenhouse Gas (GHG) series of products can be used to identify and quantify point source emissions. The EMIT Level 2B Estimated Methane Plume Complexes (EMITL2BCH4PLM) Version 1 data product provides estimated methane plume complexes in parts per million meter (ppm m) along with uncertainty data. The EMITL2BCH4PLM data product will only be generated where methane plume complexes have been identified. To reduce the risk of false positives, all EMITL2BCH4ENH data undergo a manual review (or identification and confirmation) process before being designated as a plume complex. For more information on the manual review process, see Section 4.2.2 of the EMIT GHG Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). Each EMITL2BCH4PLM granule is sized to a specific plume complex but may cross multiple EMITL2BCH4ENH granules. A list of source EMITL2BCH4ENH granules is included in the GeoTIFF file metadata as well as the GeoJSON file. Each EMITL2BCH4PLM granule contains two files: one Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file at a spatial resolution of 60 meters (m) and one GeoJSON file. The EMITL2BCH4PLM COG file contains a raster image of a methane plume complex extracted from EMITL2BCH4ENH v001 data. The EMITL2BCH4PLM GeoJSON file contains a vector outline of the plume complex, a list of source scenes, coordinates of the maximum enhancement values, and the uncertainty of the plume complex.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty. ABSTRACT",

    "description": "The \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. \n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUA_AQUA_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The most recent 7 days of data are available online. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 degrees to +82 degrees latitude), with each profile spaced 1.5 degrees or ~165 km along the orbit track (roughly 15 orbits per day). The vertical coverage is from 100 to 1 hPa.\n\nThe MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the Earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT User Guide and the MLS L2 Data Quality Document for Standard Products.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: \n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (Aqua)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. \n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "description": "TMPA (3B40RT) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG datasets (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-E/06, 10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-L/06).\n\n These data were output from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), the Near Real-Time (RT) processing stream.  The latency was about seven hours from the observation time, although processing issues may delay or prevent this schedule. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to e.g. research quality product 3B42.  This particular dataset is an intermediate high-quality (HQ) estimate from merged Microwave precipitation estimates.\n\nData files start with a header consisteing  of a 2880-byte header record containing ASCII characters. The header line makes the file nearly self-documenting, in particular spelling out the\nvariable and version names, and giving the units of the variables. Immediately after the header follow the data fields.  All fields are 1440x720 grid boxes (0-360�E,90�N-S). The first grid box center is at (0.125�E,89.875�N).  The grid increments most rapidly to the east.  Grid boxes without valid data are filled with the (2-byte integer) \"missing\" value -31999. Estimates are only computed for the band 70�N-S. This binary data sets are in IEEE ?big-endian? floating-point format.\n\nFiles are produced every 3 hours on synoptic observation hours (00, 03, ..., 21 UTC) as an accumulation of all HQ swath data observed within +/-90 minutes of the nominal file time. I.e. Each file is a snapshot considered to represent the three-hour period centered on the \"nominal\" file time.  So, e.g., 00 UTC nominally represents the period from 2230 UTC of the previous day to 0130 UTC of the current day.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP13_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNF) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-9 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

The mapped lichens are important winter forage for the nine resident caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herds in the region. A random forest modeling approach with vegetation inputs and environmental and spectral predictors was used to estimate lichen cover for 2015. Input data for the model were aggregated from historical in-situ vegetation plots, visual aerial surveys, and recent unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery to align with 30 m resolution Landsat pixels over the 583,200 km2 study area. The model was also used to estimate lichen cover for the year 2000 by applying the trained model to historical Landsat imagery. An estimate of lichen volume in 2015, based on a published algorithm, is also provided. In addition, site-level presence-absence maps at &lt;1 m resolution and site-level lichen cover maps at both 2 m and 30 resolution are provided.

The study encompasses 18 years between the period 2000-2017. Wolves were captured from eight populations following standard animal care protocols and released with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. Data from 388 wolves were used to estimate den initiation dates (n=227 dens of 106 packs) and reproductive success in the eight populations. Each population was monitored from 1 to 12 years between 2000 and 2017. Denning parturition phenology was measured each year as the number of calendar days from January 1st to the initiation date of each documented denning event. Reproductive success was determined as to whether pups survived through the end of August following a reproductive event. To evaluate the effect of climate factors on reproductive phenology, aggregated seasonal climate metrics for temperature, precipitation, and snow water equivalent based on three biological seasons for seasonal wolf home ranges were produced. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data were used to estimate phenological metrics such as the start of the growing season (SOS), length of the growing season (LOS), and time-integrated NDVI (tiNDVI), and were summarized for the populations' home range.",

LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 simulates peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics, peatland vegetation, and methane emissions.The model processes can be simulated on an area-averaged 0.5 or 1.0 degree grid cell basis at global, regional, or site scales and on a daily, monthly, or annual time step as appropriate. Input driver data are monthly mean air temperature, total precipitation, percentage of full sunshine, annual atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil texture class. The simulation for each grid cell begins from \"bare ground\", requiring a \"spin up\" (under non-transient climate) of ca. 1,000 years to develop equilibrium vegetation, carbon, and soil structure. Model simulations compare favorably, with some exceptions, to field observations collected from peatland sites (e.g., Degero, Sweden; Lakkasuo, Finland; BOREAS Northern Study Area, Canada; and others) and non-peatland sites (e.g., Point Barrow, Alaska, and Spasskaya, Siberia). LPJ-WHyMe is a further development of LPJ-WHy, which dealt with the introduction of permafrost and peatlands into LPJ. Implementing peatlands in LPJ required the addition of two new plant functional types (PFTs) (flood tolerant C3 graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) to the already existing ten PFTs, the introduction of inundation stress for non-peatland PFTs, a slow-down in decomposition under inundation, and the addition of a root exudates pool. LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 adds a methane model subroutine. This model product has one compressed data file (*.zip) and seven companion files.",

Relatively fresh tracks (usually &lt;24 h) of common large mammal predators (bobcats, coyotes, cougars, and wolves) and their ungulate prey (caribou, Dall sheep, moose, mule deer, and white-tailed deer) were investigated to determine how snow affects predator-prey interactions. The track sink depth and dimensions (width and length) of three consecutive footprints were measured from one individual. Age class was recorded for moose based either on visual confirmation of an individual creating snow tracks or based on track dimensions. The ability to differentiate age classes for smaller ungulates was more uncertain, so age classes for deer, caribou, or sheep were not specified. Animal gait was identified using a simple classification scheme. Data also include animal species, snow density, hardness, total ice, surface temperature, and vegetation type. To best capture snow hardness, surface penetrability and hand-hardness were measured throughout the snowpack. The data are provided in comma-separated values (CSV) format.",

    "title": "JPL GRACE and GRACE-FO Mascon Ocean, Ice, and Hydrology Equivalent Water Height Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) Filtered Release 06.1 Version 03",
    "description": "This dataset contains gridded monthly global water storage/height anomalies relative to a time-mean, derived from GRACE and GRACE-FO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach (RL06.1Mv03). This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines. These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines, and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals. In a post-processing step, the CRI filter is applied to those mixed land/ocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass. The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset. Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field, a set of optional gain factors (for continental hydrology applications) that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at sub-mascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data. This RL06.1Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 (DOI, 10.5067/TEMSC-3JC62). RL06.1Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in the Level-1B accelerometer transplant data that is used for the GF2 (GRACE-FO 2) satellite; RL06.1Mv03 uses the ACH data product For more information, please visit https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/. For a detailed description on the Mascon solution, including the mathematical derivation, implementation of geophysical constraints, and solution validation, please see Watkins et al., 2015, doi: 10.1002/2014JB011547.

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.",

    "title": "JPL GRACE and GRACE-FO Mascon Ocean, Ice, and Hydrology Equivalent Water Height JPL Release 06.1 Version 03",
    "description": "This dataset contains gridded monthly global water storage/height anomalies relative to a time-mean, derived from GRACE and GRACE-FO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach (RL06.1Mv03). These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. It should be noted that this dataset does not correct for leakage errors across coastlines; it is therefore recommended only for users who want to apply their own algorithm to separate between land and ocean mass very near coastlines. This RL06.1Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 (DOI, 10.5067/TEMSC-3JC62). RL06.1Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in the Level-1B accelerometer transplant data that is used for the GF2 (GRACE-FO 2) satellite; RL06.1Mv03 uses the ACH data product. For more information, please visit https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/. For a detailed description on the Mascon solution, including the mathematical derivation, implementation of geophysical constraints, and solution validation, please see Watkins et al., 2015, doi: 10.1002/2014JB011547.

The model simulations resulted from a synthesis effort organized by the Permafrost Carbon Network to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the carbon cycle in permafrost regions in the high northern latitudes.  The model teams used different historical input weather data, but most used driver data developed by the Climate Research Unit - National Centers for Environmental Prediction (CRUNCEP) as modified for the Multiscale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP).  The teams scaled the driver data for the projections using output from global climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The synthesis evaluated the terrestrial carbon cycle in the modern era and projected future emissions of carbon under two climate warming scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP45 and RCP85) from CMIP5. RCP45 represents emissions resulting in a global climate close to the target climate in the Paris Accord. RCP85 represents unconstrained greenhouse gas emissions.",

Climatological Summary Product contents contain monthly average of D1 quantities including mean diurnal cycle, distribution and properties of total cloudiness and cloud types.\r\n\r\nThe International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), was established in 1982 (WMO-35 1982, Schiffer and Rossow 1983): \r\n- To produce a global, reduced resolution, calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information on the properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters can be derived. \r\n- To stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate models. \r\n- To promote research using ISCCP data that contributes to improved understanding of the Earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nSince 1983 an international group of institutions has collected and analyzed satellite radiance measurements from up to five geostationary and two polar orbiting satellites to infer the global distribution of cloud properties and their diurnal, seasonal and interannual variations. The primary focus of the first phase of the project (1983-1995) was the elucidation of the role of clouds in the radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and surface). In the second phase of the project (1995 onwards) the analysis also concerns improving understanding of clouds in the global hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nThe ISCCP analysis combines satellite-measured radiances (Stage B3 data, Schiffer and Rossow 1985), Rossow et al. 1987) with the TOVS atmospheric temperature-humidity and ice/snow correlative data sets to obtain information about clouds and the surface. The analysis method first determines the presence of absence of clouds in each individual image pixel and retrieves the radiometric properties of the cloud for each cloudy pixel and of the surface for each clear pixel. The pixel analysis is performed separately for each satellite radiance data set and the results reported in the Stage DX data product, which has a nominal resolution of 30 km and 3 hours. The Stage D1 product is produced by summarizing the pixel-level results every 3 hours on an equal-area map with 280 km resolution and merging the results from separate satellites with the atmospheric and ice/snow data sets to produce global coverage at each time. The Stage D2 data product is produced by averaging the Stage D1 data over each month, first at each of the eight three hour time intervals and then over all time intervals.",

The surface type masks are versioned and archived at NSIDC, so users can tell which data to expect in each product.  Each data granule has an associated browse product.",

This data set contains 3-hourly, 280 KM equal-area grid data from various polar and geostationary satellites. The Gridded Cloud Product contents are spatial averages of DX quantities and statistical summaries, including properties of cloud types. Satellites are merged into a global grid. Atmosphere and surface properties from TOVS are appended. Data collection for this data set is complete. \r\n\r\nISCCP, the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), was established in 1982 (WMO-35 1982, Schiffer and Rossow 1983) to: produce a global, reduced resolution, calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information on the properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters can be derived; stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate models; and promote research using ISCCP data that contributes to improved understanding of the Earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nStarting in 1983 an international group of institutions collected and analyzed satellite radiance measurements from up to five geostationary and two polar orbiting satellites to infer the global distribution of cloud properties and their diurnal, seasonal and interannual variations. The primary focus of the first phase of the project (1983-1995) was the elucidation of the role of clouds in the radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and surface). In the second phase of the project (1995 onward) the analysis also concerns improving understanding of clouds in the global hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nThe ISCCP analysis combined satellite-measured radiances (Stage B3 data, Schiffer and Rossow 1985), Rossow et al. 1987) with the TOVS atmospheric temperature-humidity and ice/snow correlative data sets to obtain information about clouds and the surface. The analysis method first determined the presence of absence of clouds in each individual image pixel and retrieves the radiometric properties of the cloud for each cloudy pixel and of the surface for each clear pixel. The pixel analysis was performed separately for each satellite radiance data set and the results were reported in the Stage DX data product, which had a nominal resolution of 30 km and 3 hours. The Stage D1 product was produced by summarizing the pixel-level results every 3 hours on an equal-area map with 280 km resolution and merging the results from separate satellites with the atmospheric and ice/snow data sets to produce global coverage at each time. The Stage D2 data product was produced by averaging the Stage D1 data over each month, first at each of the eight three hour time intervals and then over all time intervals.",

LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 simulates peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics, peatland vegetation, and methane emissions.The model processes can be simulated on an area-averaged 0.5 or 1.0 degree grid cell basis at global, regional, or site scales and on a daily, monthly, or annual time step as appropriate. Input driver data are monthly mean air temperature, total precipitation, percentage of full sunshine, annual atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil texture class. The simulation for each grid cell begins from \"bare ground\", requiring a \"spin up\" (under non-transient climate) of ca. 1,000 years to develop equilibrium vegetation, carbon, and soil structure. Model simulations compare favorably, with some exceptions, to field observations collected from peatland sites (e.g., Degero, Sweden; Lakkasuo, Finland; BOREAS Northern Study Area, Canada; and others) and non-peatland sites (e.g., Point Barrow, Alaska, and Spasskaya, Siberia). LPJ-WHyMe is a further development of LPJ-WHy, which dealt with the introduction of permafrost and peatlands into LPJ. Implementing peatlands in LPJ required the addition of two new plant functional types (PFTs) (flood tolerant C3 graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) to the already existing ten PFTs, the introduction of inundation stress for non-peatland PFTs, a slow-down in decomposition under inundation, and the addition of a root exudates pool. LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 adds a methane model subroutine. This model product has one compressed data file (*.zip) and seven companion files.",

The AGB estimates were derived from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) Level 1B2 Terrain radiance data and a multi-angle approach that exploits the relationship between forest AGB and a suite of red band reflectance values modeled at viewing angles with respect to the direction of illumination. The year 2000 National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD 2000) AGB estimates were used to fit a model coefficient for the MISR-derived AGB estimates for the year 2000, with AGB estimates for all subsequent years dependent on both this coefficient and MISR red band bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). Quality assurance (QA) files are also provided that allow users to impose criteria of varying stringency. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model-fitting root mean square error (RMSE) value was used as one of the criteria to determine if the AGB estimates were reasonable. This dataset is the first example of forest AGB estimation based on a multi-angle index applied using MISR data.",

    "description": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost that is typically measured at specific locations using probing, in situ temperature sensors, or other ground-based observations. The thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth, in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface. This data set includes the mean Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) over years 2006 to 2011 for the region near Barrow, Alaska. The data were produced by an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that measures seasonal surface subsidence and infers ALT. ReSALT estimates were validated by comparison with ground-based ALT obtained using probing and Ground Penetrating Radar at multiple sites. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.These data provide gridded (30-m) estimates of active layer thickness (cm; ALT) and seasonal subsidence (cm), as well as calculated uncertainty in each of these parameters.

A total of 10 and 7 sensors recorded usable data at the west and east sites, respectively, from the beginning of the snow season in November 2016 through the end in June 2017.\n\nThese data can be used for a variety of purposes, including: model forcing, calibration, and validation; evaluation of airborne and satellite remote sensing data; to analyze how vegetation affects snow accumulation and ablation.",

MMOD was derived from the daily 19V (K-band) and 37V (Ka-band) GHz bands from the Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Passive Microwave (PMW) EASE-Grid Brightness Temperature (Tb) Earth System Data Record (ESDR). The PMW MMOD dataset was validated using the transition date from Freeze Degree Days (FDD) to Thaw Degree Days (TDD) from in situ air temperature observations from 31 SNOw TELemetry network (SNOTEL) observations, and compared to the established Freeze-Thaw ESDR (FT-ESDR) spring onset date. The resulting MMOD data record is suitable for documenting the spatial-temporal impacts of MMOD variability in ecosystem services, wildlife movements, and hydrologic processes across the ABoVE domain. The data from 1988-2016 included a coastal mask removing coastal pixels due to potential water contamination from coarse brightness temperature observations (Dersken et al., 2012). There is not a coastal mask for the 2017-2018 data. The full data are included, and data users should be aware that coastal values can be adversely affected by adjacent water bodies.",

    "title": "NRT AMSR2 Unified L3 Daily 6.25 km Polar Gridded 89 GHz Brightness Temperatures V4",
    "description": "The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on the Global Change Observation Mission - Water 1 (GCOM-W1) provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles. Near real-time (NRT) products are generated within 3 hours of the last observations in the file, by the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) at the AMSR Science Investigator-led Processing System (AMSR SIPS), which is collocated with the Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC) DAAC.  The NRT AMSR2 Unified L3 Daily 6.25 km Polar Gridded 89 GHz Brightness Temperatures, Version 4 uses as input the resampled brightness temperature (Level-1R) data provided by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).  The Version 4 dataset uses the AMSR-U2 product generation algorithm with slight modifications for NRT product generation, same algorithm used to generation the standard, science quality, data that is available at the NSIDC DAAC.  This Level-3 gridded product includes brightness temperatures at 89.0 GHz. Data are mapped to a polar stereographic grid at 6.25 km spatial resolution. This product is an intermediate product during processing of LANCE AMSR2 Level-3 sea ice products at 12.5 km and 25 km resolution. Data are stored in HDF-EOS5/netCDF-CF  format and are available via HTTP from the EOSDIS LANCE system at https://lance.nsstc.nasa.gov/amsr2-science/data/level3/seaice6.  If data latency is not a primary concern, please consider using science quality products. Science products are created using the best available ancillary, calibration and ephemeris information. Science quality products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth's geophysical properties to support science. These standard product, science quality, are available at the NSIDC DAAC: https://nsidc.org/",

    "description": "The aerial photography inventoried by the Pilot Land Data System \n(PLDS) at NASA AMES Research Center has been transferred to the USGS\nEROS  Data Center.  The photos were obtained from cameras mounted on\nhigh and  medium altitude aircraft based at the NASA Ames Research\nCenter.  Several  cameras with varying focal lengths, lenses and film\nformats are used, but  the Wild RC-10 camera with a focal length of 152\nmillimeters and a 9 by 9  inch film format is most common.  The positive\ntransparencies are typically  used for ancillary ground checks in\nconjunctions with digital processing for  the same sites.  The aircraft\nflights, specifically requested by scientists  performing approved\nresearch, often simultaneously collect data using other  sensors on       \nboard (e.g. Thematic Mapper Simulators (TMS) and Thermal Infrared \nMultispectral Scanners).  High altitude color infrared photography is\nused  regularly by government agencies for such applications as crop\nyield forecasting,  timber inventory and defoliation assessment, water\nresource management,  land use surveys, water pollution monitoring, and\nnatural disaster  assessment.\n\nTo order, specify the latitude and longitude of interest.  You will  then be\ngiven a list of photos available for that location.  In some cases,  \"flight\nbooks\" are available at EDC that describe the nature of the mission  during\nwhich the photos were taken and other attribute information.

It is a merged product containing separate snow and sea ice data sets. The values given are fractional coverage for 5-day intervals. Data collection for this data set is complete. \r\n\r\nThe data were collected on a global equal-area grid with the cell area equivalent to 1 degree latitude/longitude at the equator. The grid began at the South Pole with the intersection of the Greenwich meridian (0 degree longitude) and the South Pole as a cell corner. Ice/Snow Data Set contents included 5-day averages of snow and sea ice fractional coverage. Snow is deduced from visible satellite imagery plus ground data while sea ice was deduced from ship/shore and visible satellite imagery, and microwave measurements. \r\n\r\nISCCP was the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), to collect and analyze satellite radiance measurements to infer the global distribution of cloud radiative properties and their diurnal and seasonal variations. These data and analysis products were used to improve the understanding and modeling of the effects of clouds on climate. The ISCCP version of the ice/snow data set included only information concerning fractional coverage. The version actually used in the cloud analysis was changed in two ways: reductions to ice/snow presence and creation of margin zones in the data. The first of these was simply the process of converting the coded parameters in the original data set to code values that indicate only the presence or absence of sea ice and/or snow. The latter process filled in nearby grid cells in the data to indicate proximity to snow or sea ice covered locations. The second change is not included in the archived version of this data.",

    "description": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost that is typically measured at specific locations using probing, in situ temperature sensors, or other ground-based observations. The thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth, in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface. This data set includes the mean Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) over years 1992 to 2000 for an area near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The data were produced by an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that measures seasonal surface subsidence and infers ALT. ReSALT estimates were validated by comparison with ground-based ALT measurements at multiple sites. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.These data provide gridded (100-m) estimates of active layer thickness (cm; ALT), seasonal subsidence (cm) and subsidence trend (mm/yr), as well as calculated uncertainty in each of these parameters. This data set was developed in support  of NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) field campaign.The data are presented in one netCDF (*.nc) file. ",

    "description": "This NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) satellite Sigma-0 dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at Brigham Young University (BYU) and is generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long. The SIR technique results in an enhanced resolution image reconstruction and gridded on an equal-area grid (for non-polar regions) at 4.45 km pixel resolution stored in SIR files; polar regions are gridded using a polar-stereographic technique. A non-enhanced version is provided at 22.25 km pixel resolution in a format known as GRD files. All files are produced in IEEE formatted binary. All data files are separated and organized by region, polarization, parameter, and sampling technique (i.e., SIR vs. GRD). The regions of China and Japan are combined into a single region. In additional to Sigma-0, various statistical parameters are provided for added guidance, including but not limited to: standard deviation, measurement counts, pixel time, Sigma-0 error, and average incidence angle.

Level 2 (L2) GLISTIN-A elevation data, available on the JPL UAVSAR website (uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov), were collected each year in 81 swaths of varying lengths and 10-12km widths and then mapped to 3m horizontal grids. This Level 3 (L3) dataset was created to facilitate analysis of the year-to-year glacier surface elevation changes. Improvements over the L2 dataset include: a consistent swath numbering scheme (1 to 81) corresponding to repeated flight lines; common regular equal-area grids for each swath; filtering and flagging of outliers; an ancillary geoid layer; and UTM map projections corresponding to swath location. The interested user may generate their own L3 DEMs at different horizontal resolutions and projections using the Python 3 resample_GLISTIN_DEMs package available which will be available from https://github.com/NASA/resample_GLISTIN_DEMs",

The DOQ combines the image characteristics of the original photograph with the georeferenced qualities of a map.\n\nDOQs are black and white (B/W), natural color, or color-infrared (CIR) images with 1-meter ground resolution.\n\nThe USGS produces three types of DOQs:\n\n1. 3.75-minute (quarter-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 3.75-minutes longitude by 3.75-minutes latitude. Most of the U.S. is currently available, and the remaining locations should be complete by 2004. Quarter-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native format consists of an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W and 24-bit band-interleaved-by-pixel (BIP) for color. DOQs in native format are cast to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and referenced to either the North American Datum (NAD) of 1927 (NAD27) or the NAD of 1983 (NAD83). GeoTIFF format consists of a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), with all geographic referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W quarter quad is 40-45 megabytes, and a color file is generally 140-150 megabytes. Quarter-quad DOQs are distributed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as uncompressed files.\n\n2. 7.5-minute (full-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 7.5-minutes longitude by 7.5-minutes latitude. Full-quad DOQs are mostly available for Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Limited coverage may also be available for other states. Full-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native is formatted with an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W. DOQs in native format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to either NAD27 or NAD83. GeoTIFF is a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format with referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W full quad is 140-150 megabytes. Full-quad DOQs are distributed via FTP as uncompressed files.\n\n3. Seamless DOQs are available for free download from the Seamless site. DOQs on this site are the most current version and are available for the conterminous U.S.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",

We apply TOMS ozone team  calibration techniques and consistent MEaSUREs SO2 (MS_SO2) algorithm, to obtain the best measurement-based ESDR of volcanic and anthropogenic SO2 masses and emissions. \n\nAs part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, the Goddard Earth Science (GES) Data and Information Data Center (DISC) has released a new SO2 Earth System Data Record (ESDR), TOMSN7SO2, re-processed using new 4 UV wavelength bands MS_SO2 algorithm that spans the full Nimbus 7 data period.

The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017), and continues (Zhang et al., 2017) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) standard Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument SO2 product (OMSO2). \n\nThe latest OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product uses new Jacobian lookup tables and more realistic model based a priori profiles in anthropogenic SO2 retrievals. This helps to more accurately account for the pixel-to-pixel variation in SO2 sensitivity due to different factors such as the vertical distribution of SO2, solar and viewing angles, surface reflectivity, and cloudiness. As compared with the previous OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V1.2 product that assumes the same SO2 sensitivity for all OMPS pixels, the new V2 anthropogenic SO2 retrievals have reduced retrieval biases especially over background regions (see Figure 1 for an example). The same updated PCA SO2 retrieval algorithm (Li et al., 2020) is also used to produce the recently released OMSO2 V2 product (doi:10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022).

    "description": "Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center generate groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week. They are based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE-FO satellite data and integrated with other observations, using a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes.\n\nThis data product is GRACE Data Assimilation for Drought Monitoring (GRACE-DA-DM) Global Version 3.0 from a global GRACE and GRACE-FO data assimilation and drought indicator product generation (Li et al., 2019). It varies from the other GRACE-DA-DM products which are from the U.S. GRACE-based drought indicator product generation (Houborg et al., 2012).\nThe GRACE-DA-DM Global V3.0 is similar to the GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 product. Both products are based on the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) Fortuna 2.5 version simulation that was created within the Land Information System data assimilation framework (Kumar et al., 2016). GRACE-DA-DM Global V3.0 drought indicator maps are derived from the GLDAS_CLSM025_DA1_D product, at 0.25 degree resolution, forced by ECMWF meteorological data, and assimilated RL06 GRACE and GRACE-FO data from the University of Texas at Austin (Save et al., 2016; Save, 2020). The  GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 is at 0.125 degree, which is based on a model simulation (not published at GES DISC) forced by NLDAS-2 meteorological data and assimilated with RL06 GRACE/GRACE-FO data.   \nMore information on GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 and previous versions of the data can be found in the README.\n\nThe GRACE-DA-DM Global V3.0 data product contains three drought indicators: Groundwater Percentile, Root Zone Soil Moisture Percentile, and Surface Soil Moisture Percentile. These drought indicators express wet or dry conditions as a percentile, indicating the probability of occurrence within the period of record from 1948 to 2014. The drought indicator data are daily, but available only one day (Monday) per week.  The data have a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degree with global coverage (60S, 180W, 90N, 180E), and a temporal range from February 2003 to present (with a 3-6 month latency). The data are archived in NetCDF format.\n\nThe GRACE-DA-DM is an operational project which produces groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week.  The operational data is available weekly with a 2-9 day latency from the NASA GRACE project home page found under the Documentation tab.  The GRACE-DA-DM data distributed here at GESDISC is the final archive version, which is generated after the latest GRACE-FO data are available.",

    "description": "Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center generate groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week. They are based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE satellite data and integrated with other observations, using a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes.\n\nThis data product is GRACE Data Assimilation for Drought Monitoring (GRACE-DA-DM) U.S. Version 4.0 data product and supersedes the GRACE-DA-DM Version 2.0. \n\nThe GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 is based on the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) Fortuna 2.5 version simulation that was created within the Land Information System data assimilation framework (Kumar et al., 2016). This simulation used the latest GRACE RL06 (GRACE; 2002-2017) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE-FO; 2018-present) Mascon solutions version 2, at 0.25 degree resolution, from the University of Texas at Austin (Save et al., 2016; Save, 2020). The CLSM soil parameters were updated to address a soil moisture dry limit issue found near Zapata, Texas. Because the root zone soil moisture frequently reaches the dry limit there, drought conditions are often “normal” when the area should be in drought. The new soil parameters resolved the issue, and the root zone soil moisture now matches closely the in-situ observation near Zapata. In the data assimilation, the baseline for Terrestrial Water Storage anomaly computation was updated to the 2003-2019 mean, whereas previous simulations used the 2003-2016 mean. The percentile computation was switched to a 7-day moving average climatology, instead of monthly, to improve the temporal transition of drought/wetness conditions.\n\nThe GRACE-DA-DM V1.0 was created by the stand alone CLSM (an older version) using the GRACE-Tellus 1 degree data from the Center for Space Research at University of Texas. The GRACE data assimilation (DA) is executed on a grid-to-grid basis in V2.0, while a basin scale average was used in V1.0 (Zaitchik et al. 2008). The V2.0 data were reprocessed (on June 14, 2017), using the GRACE RL05 Mascon solutions version 1 data set from UT CSR, for the entire period from April 1, 2002 to June 5, 2017. The reprocessing included fixes in the DA and increased the bedrock depth by 3 meters to enhance the drought indicator calculations. \n\nThe GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 uses the same configuration as the V2.0 for the DA scheme and increased bedrock depth, with the updates previously mentioned, thus supersedes the previous versions. \n\nThe GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 data product contains three drought indicators: Groundwater Percentile, Root Zone Soil Moisture Percentile, and Surface Soil Moisture Percentile. These drought indicators express wet or dry conditions as a percentile, indicating the probability of occurrence within the period of record from 1948 to 2014. The drought indicator data are daily, but available only one day (Monday) per week.  The data have  a spatial resolution of 0.125 x 0.125 degree over North America and range from April 1, 2002 to present (with a 3-6 months latency).  The data are archived in NetCDF format.",

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nThis dataset consists of a suite of historical trends in terrestrial hydrology over the conterminous United States estimated for the water years of 1980-2015 using the NCA-LDAS daily reanalysis. NCA-LDAS provides gridded daily outputs from the uncoupled Noah version 3.3 land surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution forced with NLDAS-2 meteorology (Xia et al., 2012), rescaled Climate Prediction Center precipitation, and assimilated satellite-based soil moisture, snow depth, and irrigation products (Jasinski et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019).\n\nTrends in annual hydrologic indicators are reported using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test at p &lt; 0.1 significance. An additional precipitation trend field (annual total), with no significance test applied, is included for comparison purposes. Collectively, these fields represent the bulk of the results presented in Jasinski et al. (2019).",

The model simulations resulted from a synthesis effort organized by the Permafrost Carbon Network to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the carbon cycle in permafrost regions in the high northern latitudes.  The model teams used different historical input weather data, but most used driver data developed by the Climate Research Unit - National Centers for Environmental Prediction (CRUNCEP) as modified for the Multiscale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP).  The teams scaled the driver data for the projections using output from global climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).

Denning parturition phenology was measured each year as the number of calendar days from January 1st to the initiation date of each documented denning event. Reproductive success was determined as to whether pups survived through the end of August following a reproductive event. To evaluate the effect of climate factors on reproductive phenology, aggregated seasonal climate metrics for temperature, precipitation, and snow water equivalent based on three biological seasons for seasonal wolf home ranges were produced.

    "description": "This model product provides the Fortran 77 source code for the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) Wetland Hydrology and Methane Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1), auxiliary C++ routines, ASCII and NetCDF input data, and NetCDF example output data. LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 simulates peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics, peatland vegetation, and methane emissions.The model processes can be simulated on an area-averaged 0.5 or 1.0 degree grid cell basis at global, regional, or site scales and on a daily, monthly, or annual time step as appropriate. Input driver data are monthly mean air temperature, total precipitation, percentage of full sunshine, annual atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil texture class. The simulation for each grid cell begins from \"bare ground\", requiring a \"spin up\" (under non-transient climate) of ca. 1,000 years to develop equilibrium vegetation, carbon, and soil structure. Model simulations compare favorably, with some exceptions, to field observations collected from peatland sites (e.g., Degero, Sweden; Lakkasuo, Finland; BOREAS Northern Study Area, Canada; and others) and non-peatland sites (e.g., Point Barrow, Alaska, and Spasskaya, Siberia). LPJ-WHyMe is a further development of LPJ-WHy, which dealt with the introduction of permafrost and peatlands into LPJ. Implementing peatlands in LPJ required the addition of two new plant functional types (PFTs) (flood tolerant C3 graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) to the already existing ten PFTs, the introduction of inundation stress for non-peatland PFTs, a slow-down in decomposition under inundation, and the addition of a root exudates pool. LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 adds a methane model subroutine. This model product has one compressed data file (*.zip) and seven companion files.",

Daily estimates of GPP were derived from a light-curve model that was fitted and validated over a network of ABoVE domain Ameriflux flux towers then upscaled using MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) data to span the extended ABoVE domain. In general, the methods involved three steps; the first step involved collecting and processing mainly carbon-flux site-level data, the second step involved the analysis and correction of site-level MAIAC data, and the final step developed a framework to produce large-scale estimates of GPP. The light-curve parameter model was generated by upscaling from flux tower sub-daily temporal resolution by deconvolving the GPP variable into 3 components: the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (aPAR), the maximum GPP or maximum photosynthetic capacity (GPPmax), and the photosynthetic limitation or amount of light needed to reach maximum capacity (PPFDmax). GPPmax and PPFDmax were related to satellite reflectance measurements sampled at the daily scale. GPP over the extended ABoVE domain was estimated at a daily resolution from the light-curve parameter model using MODIS MAIAC daily reflectance as input. This framework allows large-scale estimates of phenology and evaluation of ecosystem sensitivity to climate change.",

CAPS measures particle size distributions in a size range between nominally 0.5 micrometers and 960 micrometers. The sizes range between approximately 0.5 and 50 micrometers is covered by the optical particle counter component of CAPS-the Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer with Depolarization Detection (CAS-DPOL). The sizes range from 15 to 930 micrometers is measured with the optical array probe called Cloud imaging Probe (CIP). Cloud types are determined using an algorithm developed to detect and classify clouds using measurements of CAPS. Relative humidity and temperature are considered by the algorithm. The cloud indicator provides a classification on a 1 Hz basis and separates data in cloud-free, aerosol-cloud transition regime (ACTR), liquid clouds, clouds in the mixed-phase temperature regime (MPTR), and cirrus clouds. The coarse aerosol product provides cloud and aerosol particle number concentrations at standard pressure (1013.25 hPa) and standard temperature (273.15 K) in selected size ranges.

The particle files describe the motion of particles released backward in time over a 10-day period. The particle files are separated into archives by platform type (some platforms are combined) and can be characterized as either low resolution or high resolution depending on whether the subsequent footprint fields were generated on a circumpolar 0.5-degree grid (low-resolution) or both 0.5-degree and 0.1-degree grids (high-resolution). The platforms include flux towers at fixed sites, laboratory measurements of whole air samples collected by Programmable Flask Packages (PFP) onboard aircraft, and observations by NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite. These particle files were thinned to retain particle location information only when the particles have non-zero contributions to the corresponding footprint field.

Measurements were taken at a remotely-sensed methane hotspot on the shoreline of a pond, adjacent to BTL with a Los Gatos Ultra-Portable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (UGGA), and from various non-hotspot surfaces representative of the broader thermokarst lake ecosystem with bucket chambers. All data were collected between 2019-07-04 and 2019-12-04 during the daytime hours of 09:35-17:32 local time. A ground-based CH4 enhancement survey was performed on 2019-07-06 between 13:25-17:15 Alaska Daylight Time (AKDT), approximately two hours following an AVIRIS-NG overflight and hotspot detection at the Eastside Pond. Methane flux is reported in units of both mmol CH4 m-2 hr-1 and mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Flux errors are quantified for each",

    "description": "This dataset provides the annual date of snowpack seasonal beginning melt (i.e., main melt onset date, MMOD) across northwest Canada; Alaska, U.S.; and parts of far eastern Russia at 6.25 km resolution for the period 1988-2018. MMOD was derived from the daily 19V (K-band) and 37V (Ka-band) GHz bands from the Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Passive Microwave (PMW) EASE-Grid Brightness Temperature (Tb) Earth System Data Record (ESDR). The PMW MMOD dataset was validated using the transition date from Freeze Degree Days (FDD) to Thaw Degree Days (TDD) from in situ air temperature observations from 31 SNOw TELemetry network (SNOTEL) observations, and compared to the established Freeze-Thaw ESDR (FT-ESDR) spring onset date. The resulting MMOD data record is suitable for documenting the spatial-temporal impacts of MMOD variability in ecosystem services, wildlife movements, and hydrologic processes across the ABoVE domain. The data from 1988-2016 included a coastal mask removing coastal pixels due to potential water contamination from coarse brightness temperature observations (Dersken et al., 2012). There is not a coastal mask for the 2017-2018 data. The full data are included, and data users should be aware that coastal values can be adversely affected by adjacent water bodies.",

    "description": "This data set provides a time series of global peatland carbon balance and carbon dioxide emissions from land use change throughout the Holocene (the past 11,000 yrs). Global peatland carbon balance was quantified using a) a continuous net carbon balance history throughout the Holocene derived from a data set of 64 dated peat cores, and b) global model simulations with the LPX-Bern model hindcasting the dynamics of past peatland distribution and carbon balance. CO2 emissions from land-use change are based on published scenarios for anthropogenic land use change (HYDE 3.1, HYDE 3.2, KK10) covering the last 10,000 years. This combination of model estimates with CO2 budget constraints narrows the range of past anthropogenic land use change emissions and their contribution to past carbon cycle changes.",

    "description": "This dataset provides absolute water level elevations derived for 10 locations across the Wax Lake Delta, Atchafalaya Basin, in Southern Louisiana, USA, within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) floodplain. Field measurements were made during the Pre-Delta-X campaign on October 13-20, 2016. Relative water level measurements were recorded every five minutes during a one-week period using in situ pressure transducers (Solinst) to measure water surface elevation change with millimeter accuracy. The Solinst system combines a total pressure transducer (TPT) and a temperature detector. Once underwater, the TPT measures the sum of the atmosphere and water pressure above the sensor. Atmospheric pressure fluctuations must be accounted for to obtain the height of the water column above the TPT. An absolute elevation correction was applied to the water level data using an iterative approach with the USGS Calumet Station water level height and Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) lidar water level profiles. These Pre-Delta-X water level measurements served to calibrate and validate the campaign's remote sensing observations and hydrodynamic models.",

The projections are produced using the NCAR-CIDR Spatial Population Downscaling Model developed by the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research (CIDR) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The model incorporates assumptions based on future development scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways or SSPs) and emissions trajectories (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs).

Climate models using low and high emissions scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, then drive climate impact models on water availability, crop productivity, and pasturelands (where cropping does not occur), as well as flood impacts, from the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). Sea-level rise impacts in the coastal zone are estimated to be 1 meter under RCP2.6 and 2 meters under RCP8.5, to account for potential storm surge or coastal flooding. Four scenarios are generated, a pessimistic reference scenario combining SSP4 and RCP8.5, a more climate-friendly scenario combining SSP4 and RCP2.6, a more inclusive development scenario combining SSP2 and RCP8.5, and an optimistic scenario combining SSP2 and RCP2.6. Each scenario provides an ensemble average of four model runs combining different climate impact models as well as confidence intervals to better capture uncertainties.

    "description": "This data set contains biomass estimates for coarse roots measured on the forest floor and measurements of fine root growth down to 2-m depth at the km 67 Rainfall Exclusion Experiment site, Tapajos National Forest, Brazil. The study site was part of a rainfall exclusion experiment that was conducted from 1999-2006 to develop an understanding of the physical processes driving the observed soil water dynamics at the site. All surface roots intersected along three 1000-m long x 1-m wide transects were identified to species, measured, and biomass calculated. The collections were made on January 26, 2001 during the experimental rain exclusion period.The fine root growth was measured from 0.5-m to 2-m depth with a rhizotron. The rhizotron tubes were inserted into deep soil pits in the control and treatment plots. Average root growth measurements are provided by depth interval on a monthly basis from July 25, 2000 to December 14, 2003. DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS: There are discrepancies with the documentation, collection dates reported and collection method for fine roots utilizing rhizotrons. ",

    "description": "This dataset provides a reference of land surface phenology (LSP) at 30-m pixels for 78 regions of 10 x 10 km2 across a wide range of ecological and climatic regions in North America during 2019 and 2020. The data were derived by fusing the Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with near- surface PhenoCam time series (hereafter called HP-LSP). The HP-LSP dataset consists of two parts: (1) the 3-day synthetic gap-free EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series and (2) four key phenological transition dates that are greenup onset, maturity onset, senescence onset, and dormancy onset (accuracy less than or equal to five days). The PhenoCam network offers near-surface observations via the RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) imagery every 30 minutes. Each RGB imagery enables us to calculate as many as 100 Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) for generating a collection of localized vegetation dynamics. The HLS EVI2 time series with frequent gaps was fused with the most comparable PhenoCam GCC temporal shape selected from the GCC collection using the Spatiotemporal Shape Matching Model (SSMM) to create the synthetic gap-free HLS-PhenoCam EVI2 time series, which was used to establish the physically-based hybrid piecewise logistic model (HPLM) for detecting phenological transition dates (phenometrics).",

The data product includes information about GPP and Net Photosynthesis (PSN). The PSN band values are the GPP less the Maintenance Respiration (MR). The data product also contains a PSN Quality Control (QC) layer. The quality layer contains quality information for both the GPP and the PSN.\n\nThe MOD17A2HGF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MOD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod15a2h.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MOD17A2HGF is the improved MOD17, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation  (FPAR/LAI) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD17A2HGF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nStage 3 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) validation has been achieved for MOD17 products.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR. \n\n\n",

    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Vegetation Indices (VNP13A1) Version 1 data product provides vegetation indices by a process of selecting the best available pixel over a 16-day acquisition period at 500 meter (m) resolution. The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series observations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive to canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. EVI2 is a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and NIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing VIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2 will eventually become the standard EVI. \r\n\r\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also includes layers for NIR reflectance; three shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance; red, blue, and green reflectance; composite day of year; pixel reliability; relative azimuth, view, and sun angles; and a quality layer. Two low resolution browse images are also available for each VNP13A1 product: EVI and NDVI.",

In generating this monthly product, the algorithm ingests all the MYD13A2 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD13A2.061) products that overlap the month and employs a weighted temporal average. \n\nThe MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from surface reflectances corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols.\n\nVegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes as well as global and regional climate. Additional applications include characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, such as primary production and land cover conversion.\n\nProvided along with the vegetation layers and the two quality assurance (QA) layers are reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as three observation layers.\n\nValidation at stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Vegetation Index product suite.

    "description": "This dataset contains Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Level 4A (L4A) Version 2 predictions of the aboveground biomass density (AGBD; in Mg/ha) and estimates of the prediction standard error within each sampled geolocated laser footprint. In this version, the granules are in sub-orbits. The algorithm setting group selection used for GEDI02_A Version 2 has been modified for Evergreen Broadleaf Trees in South America to reduce false positive errors resulting from the selection of waveform modes above ground elevation as the lowest mode. The footprints are located within the global latitude band observed by the International Space Station (ISS), nominally 51.6 degrees N and S and reported for the period 2019-04-18 to 2023-03-16. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track. The GEDI beam transects are spaced approximately 600 m apart on the Earth's surface in the cross-track direction, for an across-track width of ~4.2 km. Footprint AGBD was derived from parametric models that relate simulated GEDI Level 2A (L2A) waveform relative height (RH) metrics to field plot estimates of AGBD. Height metrics from simulated waveforms associated with field estimates of AGBD from multiple regions and plant functional types (PFTs) were compiled to generate a calibration dataset for models representing the combinations of world regions and PFTs (i.e., deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, evergreen needleleaf trees, deciduous needleleaf trees, and the combination of grasslands, shrubs, and woodlands). For each of the eight beams, additional data are reported with the AGBD estimates, including the associated uncertainty metrics, quality flags, model inputs, and other information about the GEDI L2A waveform for this selected algorithm setting group. Model inputs include the scaled and transformed GEDI L2A RH metrics, footprint geolocation variables and land cover input data including PFTs and the world region identifiers. Additional model outputs include the AGBD predictions for each of the six GEDI L2A algorithm setting groups with AGBD in natural and transformed units and associated prediction uncertainty for each GEDI L2A algorithm setting group. Providing these ancillary data products will allow users to evaluate and select alternative algorithm setting groups. Also provided are outputs of parameters and variables from the L4A models used to generate AGBD predictions that are required as input to the GEDI04_B algorithm to generate 1-km gridded products.",

The root zone depends on the vegetation type and its root distribution, and can span all three soil layers. The VIC model includes a two-layer energy balance snow model [Cherkauer et al., 2003]. \n\nThe VIC LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing \"File A\" files, and contains forty-three fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number.

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB format).\n\nMosaic was developed by Koster and Suarez (1994, 1996) to account for subgrid vegetation variability with a tile approach. Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture and temperature.  Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160 cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200 cm). \n\nDetails about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia et al.

The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1 km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product.\r\n\r\nThe VIIRS 375 m fire detection data is a Level 2 product based on the input Science Data Record (SDR) Level 1 swath format.

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.",

    "title": "ECOSTRESS Water Use Efficiency Daily L4 Global 70m V001",
    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO4WUE Version 1 data product provides Water Use Efficiency (WUE) data generated according to the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the ECOSTRESS Level 4 WUE Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/346/ECO4WUE_ATBD_V1.pdf). WUE is the ratio of carbon stored by plants to water evaporated by plants. This ratio is given as grams of carbon stored per kilogram of water evaporated over the course of the day from sunrise to sunset on the day when the ECOSTRESS granule was acquired.\r\n\r\nThe ECO4WUE Version 1 data product contains a single layer of water use efficiency. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

The GEDI L4A Footprint Biomass product converts each high-quality waveform to an AGBD prediction, and the L4B product uses the sample present within the borders of each 1 km cell to statistically infer mean AGBD. The gridding procedure is described in the GEDI L4B Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). Patterson et al. (2019) describes the hybrid model-based mode of inference used in the L4B product. Corresponding 1 km estimates of the standard error of the mean are also provided in the L4B product. Uncertainty is due to both GEDI's sampling of the 1 km area (as opposed to making wall-to-wall observations) and the fact that L4A biomass values are modeled in a process subject to error instead of measured in a process that may be assumed to be error-free.",

    "description": " Version 10r is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 10r.\n The OCO-2 SIF Lite files contain bias-corrected solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence along with other select fields aggregated as daily files. \n\nIn early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. The OCO-2 project uses the LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers.\n This collection encompass the output from the IMAP-DOAS preprocessor, which is used for both screening of the official XCO2 product as well as for the retrieval of Solar-Induced Fluorescence from the 0.76 micrometer O2 A-band. The IMAP-DOAS preprocessor, just as the ABO2 cloud screen, is implemented in the operational OCO-2 processing pipeline. \n",

Biophysical Parameters derived from the FASIR-NDVI (Fourier Adjusted, Solar zenith angle correction, Interpolation, and Reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data set developed for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection for the months of January 1982 through December 1998 were used to calculate monthly mean surface albedos at 1 X 1 degree spatial resolution for vegetated land surfaces (Sellers et al, 1996b) for the wavelength interval from 0.4 to 3.0 mm. The instantaneous albedo is a function of the properties of the land surface and the solar zenith angle. The monthly mean albedo is an average weighted over time weighted by the incident radiation. NDVI data are used to generate the biophysical parameters leaf area index (LAI) and green fraction of vegetation (Greenness) used by the canopy radiative transfer model of the Simple atmosphere (SiB2) model (Sellers et al, 1996a), which computes the instantaneous albedo. This is coupled to the Colorado State University (CSU) General Circulation Model (GCM) (Randall et al, 1989) which integrates the SiB2 radiative transfer through time. The incident radiation for weighting the time-averaged albedo was provided by a previous run of the GCM using the atmospheric radiation parameterization of Harshvardhan et al (1987). The Harshvardhan parameterization models radiative transfer through the atmosphere in both the longwave and shortwave bands, including the effects of cloudiness and water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone. The shortwave radiation distinguishes between the direct and diffuse components of the solar beam.",

    "description": "The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.",

    "description": "This dataset provides spatially-contiguous global mean daily solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) estimates at 0.05 degree (approximately 5 km at the equator) spatial and 16-day temporal resolution from September 2014 through July 2020. This product was derived from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF observations and produced by training an artificial neural network (ANN) on the native OCO-2 SIF observations and MODIS BRDF-corrected seven-band surface reflectance along OCO-2's orbits. The trained ANN model was then applied to predict mean daily SIF (mW/m2/nm/sr) in OCO-2's gap regions based on MODIS reflectance and landcover. This framework was stratified by biomes and 16-day time steps. This dataset's high resolution and global contiguous coverage will greatly enhance the synergy between satellite SIF and photosynthesis measured on the ground at consistent spatial scales. Potential applications of this dataset include advancing dynamic drought monitoring and mitigation, informing agricultural planning and yield estimation, and providing a benchmark for upcoming satellite missions with SIF capabilities at higher spatial resolutions.",

The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series observations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive to canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. EVI2 is a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and NIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing VIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2 will eventually become the standard EVI. \r\n\r\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also includes layers for the standard deviations of each Vegetation Index; NIR reflectance; three shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance; red, blue, and green reflectance; number of pixels, number of pixels used; pixel reliability; average sun angle, and a quality layer.

Specifically, the resampled DISCover datasets were derived from the 1km DISCover data set compiled by the USGS. The 1km data sets for each classification scheme were aggregated to 1, 0.5 and 0.25 degree spatial resolutions for this ISLSCP II data collection. Each layer of the aggregated products corresponds to a single DISCover land cover category and the values represent the percentage of the coarse resolution cell (1 degree, etc...)occupied by that land cover category. The dominant class data show the land cover category that occupies the majority of the cell and is derived from the percentage files for each cover type. The objective of this study was to create a land cover map derived from 1 kilometer AVHRR data using a full year of data (April 1992-March 1993). This thematic map was resampled to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. During this re-processing, the original EDC land cover type and fraction maps were adjusted to match the water/land fraction of the ISLSCP II land/water mask. These maps were generated for use by global modelers and others. This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

    "description": "The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set and derived biophysical parameter fields were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. This multiple resolution (1/4, 1/2 and 1 degree in latitude and longitude) biophysical parameter data set contains essential variables for the calculation of photosynthesis, and the energy and water exchange between the Earth's surface (in particular of vegetation) and the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere. The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is related to the light absorption and the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation. It also serves as an intermediate variable to calculate vegetation cover fraction (Vcover), total Leaf Area Index (LAI_T), green leaf area index (LAI_G), roughness length (z0), zero plane displacement (d), and snow-free albedo. The biophysical parameters were derived assuming one canopy layer. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.",

The VNP64 burned area mapping approach employs 750 m VIIRS imagery coupled with 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. The hybrid algorithm applies dynamic thresholds to composite imagery generated from a burn-sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) derived from VIIRS shortwave infrared channels M8 and M11, and a measure of temporal texture. VIIRS bands that are both sensitive and insensitive to biomass burning are used to detect changes caused by fire and to differentiate them from other types of change. The mapping algorithm ultimately identifies the date of burn, to the nearest day, for 500 m grid cells within the individual sinusoidal tile being processed. The date is encoded in a single data layer of the output product as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred (range 1–366), with a value of 0 for unburned land pixels and additional values reserved for missing data and water grid cells. The VNP64A1 data product is designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua combined burned area product to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. \r\n\r\nVNP64A1 has been released on a limited basis due to concerns over the quality of the data along the edges of inland water bodies and at high latitudes. These regions contain grid cells falsely identified as burned as a result of coarse resolution inputs to the cloud mask used in the generation of the 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. Users are urged to exercise caution when using this provisional (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/NPP_QA/NPPpage.cgi?fileName=maturity&amp;subdir=forPage) data in research.

    "description": "The Simple atmosphere Model, Version 3 (SiB3) was used to produce a global data set of hourly carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and the terrestrial atmosphere for the years 1998-2006. This data set represents the global net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial atmosphere; specifically, the flux of CO2 between the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the surface vegetation layer. Following atmospheric convention, flux is defined as positive into the atmosphere and negative into the surface vegetation.The data reported are 9 years of estimated hourly carbon flux for 14637 land points. Units are moles C/m2/sec.Data are provided in two NetCDF formats: The NetCDF format provided by the investigators -- format designed specifically to minimize disk storage volume that excludes water grid cells, and  A CF Compliant NetCDF format -- generated by the ORNL DAAC that includes both land and water grid cells.The investigator provided NetCDF formatted files can be processed using the provided  FORTRAN code (sib_process_flux.f90) and the land mask (sib_mask.nc) into hourly, daily-mean, or monthly-mean fluxes on a global 1x1 degree Cartesian grid. The monthly-mean SiB3 fluxes were compared to TransCom flux data available for years 2000-2005 (Gurney et al., 2008) as a means of evaluating overall behavior of the model. In general, SiB3 fluxes are within the error bars of the TransCom results.The CF compliant NetCDF format files have been processed by the ORNL DAAC and the hourly and summarized daily-mean and monthly-mean flux data files are provided. GeoTIFF format files:In addition, the CF convention NetCDF files were converted to GeoTIFF image files by the ORNL DAAC and are included with the data set. Companion file:Additional information about the data formats, methodology, and data quality is found in the companion file: SiB3_carbon_flux_readme.pdfAccess to GeoTIFF format files via WCS Interface:The ORNL DAAC also provides access to the GeoTIFF files via a Web Coverage Service Interface (WCS). The OpenGIS Web Coverage Service Interface Standard (WCS) defines a standard interface and operations that enables interoperable access to geospatial coverages.These data are a carbon cycle reanalysis, which may be thought of as analogous to NCEP meteorological reanalysis products. Carbon fluxes have been used by a large community of atmospheric transport modelers to create reanalysis of CO2 concentrations and the results have been evaluated against observations. In addition, the reanalyzed flux and CO2 fields are important for designing future observing strategies for the global carbon cycle.",

    "description": "This data set provides normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for the arctic growing season derived primarily with data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors onboard several NOAA satellites over the years 1982 through 2012. The NDVI data, which show vegetation activity, were averaged annually for the arctic growing season (GS; June, July and August). The products include the annual GS-NDVI values and the results of a cumulative GS-NDVI time series trends analysis. The data are circumpolar in coverage at 8-km resolution and limited to greater than 20 degrees N.These normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trends were calculated using the third generation data set from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS 3g). GIMMS 3g improves on its predecessor (GIMMS g) in three important ways. First, GIMMS 3g integrates data from NOAA-17 and 18 satellites to lengthen its record. Second, it addresses the spatial discontinuity north of 72 degrees N, by using SeaWiFS, in addition to SPOT VGT, to calibrate between the second and third versions of the AVHRR sensor (AVHRR/2 and AVHRR/3). Finally, the GIMMS 3g algorithm incorporates improved snowmelt detection and is calibrated based on data from the shorter, arctic growing season (May-September) rather than the entire year (January-December).

Two Phase 2 model experiments were run.  First, a set of selected  biogeochemical models and coupled biogeochemical-biogeographical models were run from 1895 to 1993 to compare model responses to the historical time series and current ecosystem biogeochemistry.  Second, these same models were run on the projected 1994 to 2100 data to compare their ecological responses to transient scenarios of climate and atmospheric CO2 change. Model runs were performed for daily, monthly, and annual gridded data sets. The output of the annual model runs in VEMAP grid format are contained in this data set. The models investigated included five biogeochemical cycling models, which simulate plant production and nutrient cycles.",

    "description": "The Historical Croplands Cover data set was developed to understand the consequences of historical changes in land use and land cover for ecosystem goods and services. In particular, this data set can be used to study how global changes in cultivated area has influenced climate, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, etc. This data set can be used directly within spatially-explicit climate and biogeochemical models.This is a gridded data set describing the fraction of each grid cell in the globe that is occupied by cultivated land from 1700 to 1992. Data layers are provided for every 50 years from 1700 to 1850, every 10 years from 1850 to 1980, and every year from 1986 to 1992.There are two sources of global land cover/land use data. The most recent estimates are derived from satellite measurements, and are available in a spatially-explicit fashion for roughly the last 30 years. The other estimate is based on ground-based sources such as census statistics, land surveys, estimates by historical geographers, etc. These land inventory data are only available at the scale of political units, but have the advantage of being historical. Ramankutty and Foley (1998) derived a spatially-explicit data set of croplands in 1992 by synthesizing remotely-sensed land cover data with contemporary land inventory data. Furthermore, Ramankutty and Foley (1999) extended this data set into the past (back to 1700) using historical land inventory data.The data set should only be used for continental-to-global scale analysis and modeling. The data set captures the broad patterns of cropland change over history, but not necessarily the fine details at local to regional scales - please check the data quality before using it at fine spatial scales. The quality of historical data for the Russian Federation is poor. The quality of data prior to 1850 is poor -- only continental-scale historical data were used for that period. ",

The input to the Active Fires production are Level-1B moderate-resolution reflective band M7, and emissive bands M13 and M15. The fire algorithm first calculates bands M13, M15 brightness temperature (BT) statistics for a group of background pixels adjacent to each potential fire pixel. These statistics are used to set thresholds for several contextual fire detection tests. There is also an absolute fire detection test based on a pre-set M13 BT threshold. If the results of the absolute and relative fire detection tests meet certain criteria, the pixel is labeled as fire. The designation of a pixel as fire from the results of the BT threshold tests may be overridden under sun glint conditions or if too few pixels were used to calculate the background statistics.\n\nThe VNP14_NRT product contains several pieces of information for each fire pixel: pixel coordinates, latitude and longitude, pixel M7 reflectance, background M7 reflectance, pixel M13 and M15 BT, background M13 and M15 BT, mean background BT difference, background M13, M15, and BT difference mean absolute deviation, fire radiative power, number of adjacent cloud pixels, number of adjacent water pixels, background window size, number of valid background pixels, detection confidence, land pixel flag, background M7 reflectance, and reflectance mean absolute deviation.\n\nThe product provides day and nighttime active fire detection over land and water (from gas flares). The VNP14 product provides fire data continuity with NASA's EOS MODIS 1 km fire product. \n\nFor more information visit University of Maryland VIIRS Active Fire Web page at http://viirsfire.geog.umd.edu/",

Owing to long time lags in the climate and biogeochemical systems, these models should aim to simulate the land use dynamics for long periods, i.e., spanning decades to centuries. Developing such models requires an understanding of past and current trends and is therefore strongly data dependent. For this purpose, a historical database of the global environment has been developed: HYDE. Historical statistical inventories on agricultural land (census data, tax records, land surveys, etc) and different spatial analysis techniques were used to create a geographically-explicit data set of land use change, with a regular time interval.

    "title": "CMS: Terrestrial Carbon Stocks, Emissions, and Fluxes for Conterminous US, 2001-2016",
    "description": "This dataset provides estimates of carbon pools, fluxes, and associated uncertainties across the contiguous USA (CONUS) at 0.5-degree resolution for all terrestrial land cover types. Carbon pools include labile carbon, foliar carbon, fine root, woody carbon, litter carbon, and soil organic carbon. Carbon fluxes include gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), net biome exchange, autotrophic respiration, and heterotrophic respiration. The modeled estimates are provided as monthly averages over the 16-year period, 2001 through 2016. The data were derived from the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) that included climate data, and above and below ground biomass maps of CONUS for the years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016 as input data sources to this model-data fusion framework.  The input data were integrated into the CARDAMOM model to constrain on the terrestrial carbon and to specifically attribute changes of forest carbon stocks and spatial distributions of carbon emissions and removals across forested lands. United States Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot data were used to train models for the prediction of forest above-ground biomass (AGB).",

    "description": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/viirs) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) Version 2 data product (VNP15A2H) provides information about the vegetative canopy layer at 500 meter resolution. The VIIRS sensor is located aboard the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. LAI is an index that quantifies the one-sided leaf area of a canopy, while FPAR is the fraction of incoming solar energy absorbed through photosynthesis at 400 to 700 nanometers. This product is intentionally designed after the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI/FPAR operational algorithm to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP15A2H product includes six Science Data Set Layers for the analysis of key factors in LAI/FPAR measurements. These include the LAI and FPAR measurements, quality detail for LAI/FPAR, extra quality detail for FPAR, and the standard deviation for LAI and FPAR. Two low resolution browse images are also available for each VNP15A2H granule: LAI and FPAR.",

    "description": "This dataset provides global monthly average gross primary productivity (GPP; g carbon/m2/d) modeled at 8 km spatial resolution for each of the 35 years from 1982-2016. GPP is based on the well-known Monteith light use efficiency (LUE) equation but was improved with optimized spatially and temporally explicit LUE values derived from selected FLUXNET tower site data. Optimized LUE was extrapolated to a consistent 8 km resolution global grid using multiple explanatory variables representing climatic, landscape, and vegetation factors influencing LUE and GPP. Global gridded long-term daily GPP was derived using the optimized LUE, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) canopy fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, (MERRA-2) meteorological information. These data will improve satellite-based estimation and understanding of GPP using a refined LUE model framework.",
